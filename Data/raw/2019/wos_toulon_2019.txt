The ion-imprinted resins were prepared by copolymerization of complexes prepared from Er3+. Conventional resins have low selectivity because electrostatic interactions are dominant even for the ida resin. In ion imprinting, the complex structure formed a priori in bulk solution was retained in the resin and coordinative interactions became more prominent. As a result, the selectivity coefficient K-Sm(Er) increased from 1.0 of the conventional resin to 3.5 of the imprinted resin.

We propose a new methodological framework, based on network theory and modularity concept, to determine which type of mechanisms (i.e. deterministic versus stochastic processes) has the strongest influence on structuring communities. This framework is based on the computation and comparison of two networks: the co-occurrence (based on species abundances) and the functional networks (based on the species traits values). In this way we can assess whether the species belonging to a given functional group also belong to the same co-occurrence group. We adapted the Dg index of Gauzens et al. (2015) to analyze congruence between both networks. This offers the opportunity to identify which assembly rule(s) play(s) the major role in structuring the community. We illustrate our framework with two datasets corresponding to different faunal groups and ecosystems, and characterized by different scales (spatial and temporal scales). By considering both species abundance and multiple functional traits, our framework improves significantly the ability to discriminate the main assembly rules structuring the communities. This point is critical not only to understand community structuring but also its response to global changes and other disturbances.

Insights into the Charge Separation Dynamics in Photoexcited Molecular Junctions								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	51			30885	30892		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b10911			DEC 26 2019	2019	The transient dynamics of charge transfer induced by a femtosecond laser pulse at the donor-acceptor interface of molecular junctions is investigated by means of quantum transport calculations within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. Simulations are implemented from the wave function technique extended to include Coulombic interaction within the Hartree-Fock approximation. Exciton and charge-transfer states competitively impact the molecular hybridization and thus provoke a charge localization visible in the time-resolved density of states, which modifies the time-resolved photocurrent spectra. The dynamic nature of the exciton and charge-transfer state formation leads to the definition of a dynamic driving energy. Our findings suggest the need to reconsider the role of built- in molecular orbital offset for design and experimentation. Insights provided in this work will contribute to designing ultrafast molecular optoelectronics and improving ultrafast spectroscopy techniques.

Our calculation is carried out on two different 2 + 1 flavor QCD ensembles using the isotropic-clover fermion action, with lattice dimensions 24(3) x 64 and 32(3) x 96 at the lattice spacing of a = 0.127 fm, and with the quark mass equivalent to a pion mass of m(pi) similar or equal to 415 MeV. We incorporate several combinations of smeared-point and smeared-smeared pion source-sink interpolation fields in obtaining the lattice QCD matrix elements using the summation method. After one-loop perturbative matching and combining the pseudodistributions from these two ensembles, we extract the pion valence quark distribution using a phenomenological functional form motivated by the global fits of parton distribution functions. We also calculate the lowest four moments of the pion quark distribution through the "operator product expansion without operator product expansion." We present a qualitative comparison between our lattice QCD extraction of the pion valence quark distribution with that obtained from global fits and previous lattice QCD calculations.

When these measures are invariant for the flow of a chaotic dynamical system, generalized dimensions take on a dynamical meaning, as they provide the rate function for the large deviations of the first hitting time, which is the (average) time required to connect any two different regions in phase space. We prove this result rigorously under a set of stringent assumptions. As a consequence, the statistics of hitting times provides new algorithms for the computation of the spectrum of generalized dimensions. Numerical examples, presented along with the theory, suggest that the validity of this technique reaches far beyond the range covered by the theorem. We state our result within the framework of extreme value theory. This approach reveals that hitting times are also linked to dynamical indicators such as stability of the motion and local dimensions of the invariant measure. This suggests that one can use local dynamical indicators from finite time series to gather information on the multifractal spectrum of generalized dimension. We show an application of this technique to experimental data from climate dynamics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Repolarization of Ferroelectric Superlattices BaZrO3/BaTiO(3)A								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						18948	10.1038/s41598-019-55475-2			DEC 12 2019	2019	With the use of the modified Sawyer-Tower scheme and Merz technique, studies were conducted on the repolarization characteristics of ferroelectric (BaZrO3/BaTiO3) superlattices on monocrystalline MgO substrate. Studies of temperature changes in the dielectric hysteresis loops indicated a sufficiently smooth decrease in spontaneous polarization compared with homogeneous barium titanate near the phase transition temperature of the superlattice. Experimental studies of switched currents have shown that the switching processes in the synthesized superlattices are implemented in two stages: activation motion ("creep" mode) and non-activation motion (slip mode). The presence of the activation switching stage and the numerical estimates show that with high probability, the movement of domain boundaries accomplishes the processes of switching in the studied superlattice. The threshold field separating the stated stages decreases with increasing temperature up to the Curie point of the superlattice, similar to the coercive field. Detection of the non-strictly exponential dependence of the switching current on the reverse field strength in the activation stage was modulated by the dependence with the power-law exponent for the applied electric field. Both techniques indicate that the studied superlattices have a small internal displacement field directed from the superlattice to the substrate.		[Sidorkin, A. S.; Nesterenko, L. P.; Vorotnikov, E.

However, their fabrication over large scales often requires demanding procedures that are hardly scalable. Here we synthesize arrays of parallel ultra-long (up to 0.75 mm), monocrystalline, silicon-based nano-wires and complex, connected circuits exploiting low-resolution etching and annealing of thin silicon films on insulator. Phase field simulations reveal that crystal faceting and stabilization of the wires against breaking is due to surface energy anisotropy. Wires splitting, inter-connections and direction are independently managed by engineering the dewetting fronts and exploiting the spontaneous formation of kinks. Finally, we fabricate field-effect transistors with state-of-the-art trans-conductance and electron mobility. Beyond the first experimental evidence of controlled dewetting of patches featuring a record aspect ratio of similar to 1/60000 and self-assembled similar to mm long nano-wires, our method constitutes a distinct and promising approach for the deterministic implementation of atomically-smooth, mono-crystalline electronic and photonic circuits.

Topological optimisation is a mathematical tool that can be used to obtain lighter parts without decreasing their stiffness. As the optimised part shapes are often too complex to be manufacturable, additive manufacturing is generally used. Usually, the topological optimisation is performed on a single part. However, for a product, the decreasing of mass and inertia in each individual part has an impact on the loads applied onto all the parts of the system. Moreover, different paths can be used to optimise a product, e.g. optimising all the parts simultaneously or part after part. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose, based on a case study, some optimisation principles to find the best optimisation path to design an additively manufactured product. In order to do this, the concept of topological optimisation loops is first proposed. Then, several optimisation paths are compared. In comparison with a usual single topological optimisation, the proposed method leads to an additional gain in mass of up to 35% for the case study. Finally, some optimisation principles are suggested to choose the most adapted path according to the designer objectives.

There is a third possibility: reality has a more complex temporal structure than either of these two naive options. Fundamental becoming is real, but local and unoriented. A notion of present is well defined, but only locally and in the context of approximations.

The relationship between obesity and stress is biological through the actions of stress on the major hormones that regulate appetite (leptin and ghrelin). Many spa resorts in France specialise in the treatment of obesity, but no thermal spa currently proposes a specific programme to manage stress in obesity. The ObesiStress protocol has been designed to offer a new residential stress management programme. This thermal spa treatment of obesity implements stress management strategies as suggested by international recommendations. Methods and analysis 140 overweight or obese participants with a Body Mass Index of >25 kg/m(2) and aged over 18 years will be recruited. Participants will be randomised into two groups: a control group of usual practice (restrictive diet, physical activity and thermal spa treatment) and an intervention group with stress management in addition to the usual practice. In the present protocol, parameters will be measured on five occasions (at inclusion, at the beginning of the spa (day 0), at the end of the spa (day 21), and at 6 and 12 months). The study will assess the participants' heart rate variability, cardiac remodelling and function, electrodermal activity, blood markers, anthropometric profile, body composition, psychology and quality of life via the use of questionnaires and bone parameters. Ethics and dissemination The ObesiStress protocol complies with the ethics guidelines for Clinical Research and has been approved by the ethics committee (CPP Sud-Est VI, Clermont-Ferrand - ANSM: 2016-A01774-47). This study aimed to highlight the efficacy of a 21-day thermal spa residential programme of stress management in obesity through objective measurements of well-being and cardiovascular morbidity. Results will be disseminated during several research conferences and articles published in peer-reviewed journals.

J	Loubere, Lucie; Ibekwe, Fidelia								Impact of open access scholarly publications on the Web								INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL				24	4					colis1924				DEC 2019	2019	Introduction. We present a methodology and tools for studying the impact of scholarly publications published on an open access repository on the Web. Method. From the logs to Open Edition pages, a platform that hosts mainly open access scholarly publications in the Social Sciences and Humanities, and the digital traces left on the Web by the visitors, we identified Web pages that cited publications from the Open Edition platform and delineated the citation contexts using the TextTiling thematic segmentation library. With Unitex, a natural language processing engine, we identified noun phrases from the citing Web pages and built a co-occurrence graph linking the cited Open Edition publications to the phrases found in their citation contexts on the Web. Analysis. We generated a dynamic and interactive graph interface which enables the user to navigate between the cited publications from Open Edition and their contexts of citation on the Web. Results. The exploration of the graphs showed how open access scholarly contents were being reused on the Web by various stakeholders. In particular, our method enables the user to visualise what the citing Web pages say about the cited scholarly publications, who the citers are (organizations and persons, their reasons for citing the scholarly publication and the sentiments (positive or negative) expressed by the citer(s) about the cited open access publication. Conclusions. We observed a strong lexical coherence between the cited scholarly publications from Open Edition and the citing Web pages. Also, much of the sentiments expressed by the citers were favourable (positive), thus upholding the widespread belief that the scientific enterprise is generally well regarded by members of the public at large.

J	Becker, Maike; Regula, Gabrielle; Reinhart, Guillaume; Roller, Elodie; Valade, Jean-Paul; Rack, Alexander; Tafforeau, Paul; Mangelinck-Noel, Nathalie								Simultaneous X-ray radiography and diffraction topography imaging applied to silicon for defect analysis during melting and crystallization								JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY				52				1312	1320		10.1107/S1600576719013050			DEC 1 2019	2019	One of the key issues to be resolved to improve the performance of silicon solar cells is to reduce crystalline defect formation and propagation during the growth-process fabrication step. For this purpose, the generation of structural defects such as grain boundaries and dislocations in silicon must be understood and characterized. Here, in situ X-ray diffraction imaging, historically named topography, is combined with radiography imaging to analyse the development of crystal defects before, during and after crystallization. Two individual indirect detector systems are implemented to record simultaneously the crystal structure (topographs) and the solid-liquid morphology evolution (radiographs) at high temperature. This allows for a complete synchronization of the images and for an increased image acquisition rate compared with previous studies that used X-ray sensitive films to record the topographs. The experiments are performed with X-ray synchrotron radiation at beamline ID19 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. In situ observations of the heating, melting, solidification and holding stages of silicon samples are presented, to demonstrate that with the upgraded setup detailed investigations of time-dependent phenomena are now possible. The motion of dislocations is recorded throughout the experiment, so that their interaction with grain boundaries and their multiplication through the activation of Frank-Read sources can be observed. Moreover, the capability to record with two camera-based detectors allows for the study of the relationship between strain distribution, twinning and nucleation events. In conclusion, the simultaneous recording of topographs and radiographs has great potential for further detailed investigations of the interaction and generation of grains and defects that influence the growth process and the final crystalline structure in silicon and other crystalline materials.

For this reason, telomere length (TL) has been considered as a proxy of age and stress for decades. Globally, most ecological and biology researches have used TL to assess the impact of specific life history traits on organisms' life expectancies and persistence of populations. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, ecological studies that consider TL as an approximation of temporal cohorts are rare. In many population monitoring studies, however, knowledge about temporal cohorts are lacking, although they would provide comprehensive information on the natural processes underlying population dynamics. With this in mind, a quantitative PCR approach was used to measure the relative length of telomere sequences of DNA extracted from Paracentrotus lividus sea urchin. The species undergoes intensive harvesting, and some populations are under surveillance in the Mediterranean basin. The results showed that P. lividus experiences a shortening of telomeres with age, suggesting that according to this hypothesis, TL would probably be a relevant biomarker, which could reveal population differences based on their demographic structure, and differential susceptibility to pollution according to size. Future studies are still needed to define the accuracy of TL in detecting specific temporal cohorts in this species and to determine whether the TL should be considered locally in population surveillance studies.

We first show that under the assumptions mentioned in such a paper, the proposed graph could be infinite. Then, we underline the requirement of revising the notation and adding some information on certain edges of the graph. Finally, we remark that the current version of the algorithm does not consider all possible evolutions of the net system. In the final part of the manuscript, we propose a revised algorithm for the definition and construction of the MSCG that overcomes all such limitations.

Resupply of mesopelagic dissolved iron controlled by particulate iron composition								NATURE GEOSCIENCE				12	12			995	+		10.1038/s41561-019-0476-6			DEC 2019	2019	The dissolved iron supply controls half of the oceans' primary productivity. Resupply by the remineralization of sinking particles, and subsequent vertical mixing, largely sustains this productivity. However, our understanding of the drivers of dissolved iron resupply, and their influence on its vertical distribution across the oceans, is still limited due to sparse observations. There is a lack of empirical evidence as to what controls the subsurface iron remineralization due to difficulties in studying mesopelagic biogeochemistry. Here we present estimates of particulate transformations to dissolved iron, concurrent oxygen consumption and iron-binding ligand replenishment based on in situ mesopelagic experiments. Dissolved iron regeneration efficiencies (that is, replenishment over oxygen consumption) were 10- to 100-fold higher in low-dust subantarctic waters relative to higher-dust Mediterranean sites. Regeneration efficiencies are heavily influenced by particle composition. Their make-up dictates ligand release, controls scavenging, modulates ballasting and may lead to the differential remineralization of biogenic versus lithogenic iron. At high-dust sites, these processes together increase the iron remineralization length scale. Modelling reveals that in oceanic regions near deserts, enhanced lithogenic fluxes deepen the ferricline, which alter the vertical patterns of dissolved iron replenishment, and set its redistribution at the global scale. Such wide-ranging regeneration efficiencies drive different vertical patterns in dissolved iron replenishment across oceanic provinces.		[Bressac, M.; Laurenceau-Cornec, E. C.; Boyd, P.

Taxonomic status was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Three strains (BE, BB, and AM) were selected in terms of multiple-metal resistance and plant-growth-promoting traits. They were tested on sorghum growing on ultramafic soil and compared with the reference strain C. citreum DSM20528(T). To better understand the bacterial mechanisms involved, biosorption, bioaccumulation, and biofilm formation were investigated for the representative strain of the ultramafic cluster (strain BE) versus C. citreum DSM20528(T). The polyphasic approach confirmed that all native isolates belong to the same cluster and are C. citreum. The inoculation of sorghum with strains BE and BB significantly reduced Ni content in shoots compared with inoculation with C. citreum DSM20528(T) and control values. This result was related to the higher Ni tolerance of the ultramafic strains compared with C. citreum DSM20528(T). Ni biosorption and bioaccumulation showed that BE exhibited a lower Ni content, which is explained by the ability of this strain to produce exopolysaccharides involved in Ni chelation. We suggested that ultramafic C. citreum strains are more adapted to this substrate than is C. citreum DSM20528(T), and their features allow them to enhance plant metal tolerance.

The instrument was developed from the original version, which is composed of two subscales (six items by subscales) assessing aggressiveness and anger in competitive athletes (CAAS, Maxwell & Moores, 2007). Four studies have been conducted with 1428 competitors. In the first study, the exploratory factor analysis extracted the two-factor structure from the original version, both with good internal consistency. The second study confirmed that the two-factor structure of the instrument was consistent with the original version and showed its partial invariance across genders. The third study demonstrated the temporal stability of the FVCAAS. In the fourth study, both concurrent and discriminant validities were confirmed, supporting the validity and reliability of the FVCAAS. The contributions of this study and limitations are discussed, together with perspectives for future studies of aggressiveness in competitive sports. (C) 2018 Societe Francaise de Psychologie.

The present article focuses on their legal status, in other words the collection of rules, very diverse in nature, which are applicable to them. Despite a growing international market, the question of meteorites is often ignored or regarded as a detail in international relations and is rarely taken explicitly into account in negotiations and treaties. This relative neglect explains why a non-State player, the Meteoritical Society, has taken methodological initiatives into meteoritic science and has effectively become a regulator of meteorite naming and acceptance, with a global scope. We show that to understand the legal status of meteorites, it is necessary to consider them under the prism of public international law, transnational law, and national law. We conclude that, despite the universality of meteorites as extraterrestrial objects, the variability of legal rules applicable to meteorites depending onto which territory they fall or where they are found. We note, however, that there is a trend toward regulatory uniformity in the scientific analysis of meteorites, which frames the practices of researchers and regulates traders' activities. Finally, we contend that a meteorite remains a badly defined legal object, because it can be viewed under many angles: as an object susceptible to private appropriation, as a "common thing" (res communis), or as an element of national heritage.

This allows to consider interesting models which favour multi-valued transport maps in contrast with the classical linear case (G(x, p) = integral c(x, y) dp) where finding single-valued optimal transport is a key issue. We present an existence result and a general duality principle which apply to many examples. Moreover, under a suitable subadditivity condition, we derive a Kantorovich-Rubinstein version of the dual problem allowing to show existence in some regular cases. We also consider the well studied case of Martingale transport and present some new perspectives for the existence of dual solutions in connection with F-convergence theory.

First, the atmospheric internal gravity waves (IGWs) driving the meteotsunamis are either forecasted with state-of-the-art deterministic models at least a day in advance or detected through measurements at least 2 hr before the meteotsunami reaches sensitive locations. The extreme sea-level hazard forecast at endangered locations is then derived with an innovative stochastic surrogate model-implemented with generalized polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE) method and synthetic IGWs forcing a barotropic ocean model-used with the input parameters extracted from deterministic model results and/or measurements. The evaluation of the system, both against five historical events and for all the detected potential meteotsunamis since late 2018 when the early warning system prototype became operational, reveals that the meteotsunami hazard is conservatively assessed but often overestimated at some locations. Despite some needed improvements and developments, this study demonstrates that gPCE-based methods can be used for atmospherically driven extreme sea-level hazard assessment and in geosciences in wide.

J	Novotny, Antonin								Weak solutions for a bi-fluid model for a mixture of two compressible non interacting fluids								SCIENCE CHINA-MATHEMATICS				63	12			2399	2414		10.1007/s11425-019-9552-1			DEC 2020	2020	We investigate a version of one velocity Baer-Nunziato model with dissipation for the mixture of two compressible fluids with the goal to prove for it the existence of weak solutions for arbitrary large initial data on a large time interval. We transform the one velocity Baer-Nunziato system to another "more academic" system which possesses the clear "Navier-Stokes structure". We solve the new system by adapting to its structure the Lions approach for solving the (mono-fluid) compressible Navier-Stokes equations. An extension of the theory of renormalized solutions to the transport equation to more continuity equations with renormalizing functions of several variables is essential in this process. We derive a criterion of almost uniqueness for the renormalized solutions to the pure transport equation without the classical assumption on the boundedness of the divergence of the transporting velocity. This result does not follow from the DiPerna-Lions transport theory and it is of independent interest. This criterion plays the crucial role in the identification of the weak solutions to the original one velocity Baer-Nunziato problem starting from the weak solutions of the academic problem. As far as we know, this is the first result on the existence of weak solutions for a version of the one velocity bi-fluid system of the Baer-Nunziato type in the mathematical literature.

The oscillations of the sample reflectivity are correlated with the fundamental breathing mode for wires with a diameter ranging from 150 to 350 nm and compared with solutions of the Navier equation. Taking advantage of a free standing geometry, we are able to get a mechanical quality factor of higher than 80. Coupling electron microscopy and pump and probe investigations with a very high spectral resolution performed on the same wire, we demonstrate that both shell and core diameter fluctuations are revealed and quantified. X-ray coherent diffraction measurements on individual nanowires evidence changes in the Ge-core diameter and different strain states along a single structure.

Besides providing a compact representation of the interconnections between agents, network analysis allows the identification of especially important nodes, according to various metrics that often rely on the calculation of the shortest paths connecting any two nodes. While the interpretation of a shortest paths is straightforward in binary, unweighted networks, whenever weights are reported, the calculation could yield unexpected results. We analyzed 129 studies of ecological networks published in the last decade that use shortest paths, and discovered a methodological inaccuracy related to the edge weights used to calculate shortest paths (and related centrality measures), particularly in interaction networks. Specifically, 49% of the studies do not report sufficient information on the calculation to allow their replication, and 61% of the studies on weighted networks may contain errors in how shortest paths are calculated. Using toy models and empirical ecological data, we show how to transform the data prior to calculation and illustrate the pitfalls that need to be avoided. We conclude by proposing a five-point check-list to foster best-practices in the calculation and reporting of centrality measures in ecology and evolution studies.

However, BCDI relies on both dataset collection and phase retrieval algorithms that can induce artefacts in the reconstruction. Phase retrieval algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We demonstrate how to calculate the displacement field inside a nanocrystal from its reconstructed phase depending on the mathematical convention used for the FFT. We use numerical simulations to quantify the influence of experimentally unavoidable detector deficiencies such as blind areas or limited dynamic range as well as post-processing filtering on the reconstruction. We also propose a criterion for the isosurface determination of the object, based on the histogram of the reconstructed modulus. Finally, we study the capability of the phasing algorithm to quantitatively retrieve the surface strain (i.e., the strain of the surface voxels). This work emphasizes many aspects that have been neglected so far in BCDI, which need to be understood for a quantitative analysis of displacement and strain based on this technique. It concludes with the optimization of experimental parameters to improve throughput and to establish BCDI as a reliable 3D nano-imaging technique.

J	Lajaunie-Salla, Katixa; Sottolichio, Aldo; Schmidt, Sabine; Litrico, Xavier; Binet, Guillaume; Abril, Gwenael								Comparing the efficiency of hypoxia mitigation strategies in an urban, turbid tidal river via a coupled hydro-sedimentary-biogeochemical model								NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES				19	11			2551	2564		10.5194/nhess-19-2551-2019			NOV 19 2019	2019	Coastal-water hypoxia is increasing globally due to global warming and urbanization, and the need to define management solutions to improve the water quality of coastal ecosystems has become important. The lower tidal Garonne River (TGR; southwestern France), characterized by the seasonal presence of a turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) and urban water discharge, is subject to episodic hypoxia events during low river flow periods in the summer. Future climatic conditions (higher temperature and summer droughts) and increasing urbanization could enhance hypoxia risks near the city of Bordeaux in the coming decades. A 3-D model of dissolved oxygen (DO) that couples hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemical processes was used to assess the efficiency of different management solutions for oxygenation of the TGR during summer low-discharge periods. We ran different scenarios of reductions in urban sewage overflows, displacement of urban discharges downstream from Bordeaux and/or temporary river flow support during the summer period. The model shows that each option mitigates hypoxia, but with variable efficiency over time and space. Sewage overflow reduction improves DO levels only locally near the city of Bordeaux. Downstream relocation of wastewater discharges allows for better oxygenation levels in the lower TGR. The support of low river flow limits the upstream TMZ propagation and dilutes the TGR water with well-oxygenated river water. Scenarios combining wastewater network management and low-water replenishment indicate an improvement in water quality over the entire TGR. These modelling outcomes constitute important tools for local water authorities to develop the most appropriate strategies to limit hypoxia in the TGR.

The possibility of grafting specific molecules onto 3D printed parts offers new perspectives for the development of flow systems. In this study, a MPFS system including a dicarboxylate 1,5-diphenyl-3-thiocarbazone grafted 3D-printed device has been developed for mercury determination. For this purpose, the surface of 3D-printed cuboids was first modified with amine functional groups and then grafted with dicarboxylate 1,5-diphenyl-3-thiocarbazone. This new grafted device resulted in selective mercury preconcentration with extraction and elution yields higher than 90% even at high sampling flow rates. The detection can then be carried out in two ways: a direct detection of mercury extracted onto 3D-printed grafted cuboids by atomic absorption spectrophotometry after amalgam on gold or a detection of mercury in solution after elution with L-cysteine by spectrophotometry or cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry.

Despite recent advances in understanding their taxonomic and genomic compositions, little is known about how their transcriptomes vary globally. Here, we present a dataset of 187 metatranscriptomes and 370 metagenomes from 126 globally distributed sampling stations and establish a resource of 47 million genes to study community-level transcriptomes across depth layers from pole-to-pole. We examine gene expression changes and community turnover as the underlying mechanisms shaping community transcriptomes along these axes of environmental variation and show how their individual contributions differ for multiple biogeochemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we find the relative contribution of gene expression changes to be significantly lower in polar than in non-polar waters and hypothesize that in polar regions, alterations in community activity in response to ocean warming will be driven more strongly by changes in organismal composition than by gene regulatory mechanisms.

Using a method based on the decomposition of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the unitary infinite-dimensional representations of SL(2,C) in terms of those of SU(2), we are able to provide for the first time numerical evaluations of the vertex amplitude. The values obtained support the asymptotic formula obtained by Barrett and collaborators with a saddle point approximation, showing, in particular, a power-law decay and oscillations related to the Regge action. The comparison offers a test of the efficiency of the method. Truncating the decomposition to the first few terms provides a qualitative matching of the power-law decay and oscillations. For vector and Euclidean Regge boundary data, a qualitative matching is obtained with just the first term, which corresponds to the simplified EPRL model. We comment on future developments for the numerics and extension to higher vertices. We complete our work with some analytic results: We provide an algorithm and explicit configurations for the different geometries that can arise as boundary data, and explain the geometric consequences of the decomposition used.

Each robot r(i) has a unit visibility range and can move no faster than its maximal speed v(i), for i = 1,2, ... , k. The robots can communicate between themselves. We consider two communication models: wireless, in which a message sent by a robot can reach all other robots immediately, regardless of their positions, and face-to-face (F2F), in which robots can only exchange information when they are meeting. We assume that up to f robots, where f < k, may be unreliable. We consider two models of unreliability: (1) crash faults, in which we deal with an absence of some of the robots' capabilities (communication, perception, motion, etc.), and (2) byzantine faults, in which the robots may be malicious in that they may execute a wrong algorithm (e.g., transmitting wrong information). The goal is to minimize the group search time, which is equal to the time of arrival to the target of the last reliable robot. This is expressed as a function of d, the distance from the origin to the target. Our proposed algorithms for crash faults are asymptotically optimal in d in both communication models. For byzantine faults, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal for the wireless model. In the F2F model, we propose two algorithms: the first one has a competitive ratio of 2, while the second algorithm works for k >= 2f + 2 and is optimal when the robots speeds are all equal.

Here we consider the critical case where the reference energy corresponds to the value of a crossing of two electronic levels, one of these two levels being confining while the second dissociates. We show that the survival probability associated to a certain initial state is a sum of the usual time-dependent exponential contribution, and a reminder term that is jointly polynomially small with respect to the time and the semiclassical parameter. We also compute explicitly the main contribution of the remainder. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The corresponding classical problem is the billiard in this domain. In general, the corresponding dynamical system is not integrable. The small angle is a small parameter which allows one to make the averaging and reduce the classical dynamical system to an integrable one modulo exponential small correction. We use the quantum adiabatic approximation (operator separation of variables) to construct the asymptotic eigenfunctions (quasi-modes) of the Schrodinger operator. We discuss the relation between classical averaging and constructed quasi-modes. The behavior of quasi-modes in the neighborhood of the cusp is studied. We also discuss the relation between Bessel and Airy functions that follows from different representations of asymptotics near the cusp.

In polluted areas, marine organisms may develop specific adaptive responses to prevent cell damage. To investigate the influence of copper on the metabolism of a single organism, a dual approach combining metabolomics and proteomics was undertaken on the biofilm-forming bacterial strain Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica TC8. In order to highlight differential adaptation according to the phenotype, the response of P. lipolytica TC8 to copper stress was studied in planktonic and biofilm culture modes under growth inhibitory copper concentrations. As expected, copper exposure led to the induction of defense and detoxification mechanisms. Specific metabolite and protein profiles were thus observed in each condition (planktonic vs. biofilm and control vs. copper-treated cultures). Copper exposure seems to induce drastic changes in the lipid composition of the bacterial cell membrane and to modulate the abundance of proteins functionally known to be involved in copper cell homeostasis in both planktonic and biofilm culture modes. Much more proteins differentially expressed after copper treatment were observed in biofilms than in planktonic cells, which could indicate a more heterogeneous response of biofilm cells to this metallic stress.

After a preliminary fractionation of its organic crude extracts by column chromatography, the resulting fractions were further analysed by H-1 NMR. Even though algal species of the genus Cystoseira are commonly known to produce a wide variety of meroditerpenoids, in the case of C. foeniculacea none of the fractions were found to contain such compounds: most of the fractions showed typical H-1 NMR signals of fatty acids and derivatives (mainly glycerolipids and glycolipids). Nevertheless, the thorough analysis of a sterol-enriched fraction by RP-C-8 HPLC led to the isolation, for the first time from this species, of fucosterol (1) and a mixture of saringosterols (2 and 3). The NMR data of compounds 1-3 were fully determined with the help of 1D and 2D experiments which allowed the reassignment of some attributions in comparison with those reported in the literature. This work also confirms evidence of the oxidative degradation of fucosterol into a C-24 epimeric mixture of saringosterols.

The main objective was to determine the efficiency of PL emissions in the case of these specific SiO2/Si substrates. Polycrystalline CaWO4 and CdWO4 phases were used as standards for PL emission analyses. Characterizations of films were carried out by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The PL experiments were carried out under monochromatic UV and polychromatic X-ray excitations. The PL intensities varied with tungstate film thicknesses. In the case of X-ray excitation, oscillations of PL intensities were observed. These oscillations corresponded to interferences of PL emissions, strongly correlated with the thickness of intermediate SiO2 layers. A Fabry-Perot model simulating these oscillations is applied allowing differentiating the PL responses of these films.

Planktonic diazotrophs or dinitrogen (N-2)-fixing prokaryotes are abundant in coral lagoon waters and could be an alternative nutrient source for corals. Here we incubated untreated and bleached coral colonies of Stylophora pistillata with a N-15(2)-pre-labelled natural plankton assemblage containing diazotrophs. N-15(2) assimilation rates in Symbiodiniaceae cells and tissues of bleached corals were 5- and 30-fold higher, respectively, than those measured in untreated corals, demonstrating that corals incorporate more nitrogen derived from planktonic diazotrophs under bleaching conditions. Bleached corals also preferentially fed on Synechococcus, nitrogen-rich picophytoplanktonic cells, instead of Prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes, which have a lower cellular nitrogen content. By providing an alternative source of bioavailable nitrogen, both the incorporation of nitrogen derived from planktonic diazotrophs and the ingestion of Synechococcus may have profound consequences for coral bleaching recovery, especially for the many coral reef ecosystems characterized by high abundance and activity of planktonic diazotrophs.

The objectives of the present study were to assess the changes observed in the chemical composition of the water column following resuspension of a polluted marine sediment and the consequences for the chemical composition of adjacent marine waters according to season. For that purpose, an experimental sediment resuspension protocol was performed on four distinct occasions, spring, summer, fall and winter, and the changes in nutrients, organic contaminants and inorganic contaminants were measured after mixing sediment elutriate with lagoon waters and offshore waters sampled nearby. Significant seasonal variations in the chemical composition of the contaminated sediments were observed, with a strong accumulation of PAHs in fall, whereas minimum PAH concentrations were observed during, winter. In all seasons, sediment resuspension provoked a significant enrichment in nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and trace metal elements like Ni, Cu, and Zn in offshore waters and lagoon waters, with enrichment factors that were season and site dependent. The most pronounced changes were observed for offshore waters, especially in spring and winter, whereas the chemical composition of lagoon waters was weakly impacted by the compounds supplied by sediment resuspension.

The biochemical composition (protein, carbohydrate and lipid concentrations) and energy content of size- and group-fractionated zooplankton were analyzed in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea (Marseille) over 18 months. Proteins were the most abundant biochemical compounds in all size classes and zooplankton groups, and provided the largest part of the energy content. The medium (200-1000 mu m) size classes, mainly composed of copepods, crustacean larvae and eggs, presented a higher protein and energy content than both the smallest (80-200 mu m) size class, mainly composed of phytoplankton, and the largest ( > 1000 mu m) size classes, composed of siphonophores, salps and chaetognaths. Strong and similar seasonal variations in zooplankton biochemical composition were observed in all size classes, with higher energy content associated with cold oxygen- and nutrient-rich waters in spring 2017 and winter 2018. Thus, the biochemical composition of plankton size classes and groups differed and varied seasonally along with environmental parameters. This novel approach for North-Western Mediterranean Sea may be further related with studies on the energy and nutrient transfer into pelagic food webs and contribute to understanding of how zooplanktivorous fish feeding preferences may be related to the quality of zooplankton prey.

This tidal river is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate, alternating a wet and a dry season. In the last few decades, increased economic and urban developments of HCMC have led to harmful impacts on the water quality of this tidal river, with severe eutrophication events. This situation results from the conjunction of contrasting hydrological seasons and the lack of upgraded sanitation infrastructures: indeed, less than 10% of the domestic wastewater is collected and treated before being discharged directly into urban canals or rivers. This study focuses on P dynamics because this is considered the key nutrient factor controlling freshwater eutrophication. Based on field measurements and original laboratory experiments, we assessed the P levels in the river water and sediments, and investigated P adsorption/desorption capacity onto suspended sediment (SS) within the salinity gradient observed. Field surveys showed a clear impact of the HCMC megacity on the total P content in SS, which increased threefold at HCMC Center, as compared with the upstream values (0.3-0.8 gP kg(-1)). Downstream, in the mixed estuarine area, the Total P was lower than 0.5 gP kg(-1). Laboratory experiments were carried out to characterize the influence of SS concentrations (SS = [0.25-0.9] g L-1 ), salinity (S = [2.6-9.3]) and turbulence (G = [22-44] s(-1)) on the sorption capacity of P onto sediment. The size of sediment particles and their propensity to flocculate were also originally measured with a recently developed instrument: the System for the Characterization of Aggregates and Flocs (SCAF (R)). Under the experimental conditions considered, SS concentrations had the greatest effect on the adsorption of P onto sediment, e.g., P adsorption capacity increased when SS concentrations rose. In contrast, salinity and turbulence had a smaller effect on the adsorption properties of sediments. Among these observed variables, the SS concentration was shown to be the main driver for adsorption capacity of P onto SS within the salinity gradient. We discuss the implication of these findings on understanding P dynamics within a highly urbanized, tropical estuary.		[Nguyen, Tuyet T.

Here, we describe the first systematic study of an archaeal plasmid family, the pT26-2 plasmid family. The in-depth analysis of the distribution, biogeography and host-plasmid co-evolution patterns of 26 integrated and 3 extrachromosomal plasmids of this plasmid family shows that they are widespread in Thermococcales and Methanococcales isolated from around the globe but are restricted to these two orders. All members of the family share seven core genes but employ different integration and replication strategies. Phylogenetic analysis of the core genes and CRISPR spacer distribution suggests that plasmids of the pT26-2 family evolved with their hosts independently in Thermococcales and Methanococcales, despite these hosts exhibiting similar geographic distribution. Remarkably, core genes are conserved even in integrated plasmids that have lost replication genes and/or replication origins suggesting that they may be beneficial for their hosts. We hypothesize that the core proteins encode for a novel type of DNA/protein transfer mechanism, explaining the widespread oceanic distribution of the pT26-2 plasmid family.

A higher risk of dyslipidemia, central obesity, and insulin resistance has been reported among these children. We investigated substrate utilization during submaximal exercise. Design/methods Ten brain tumor survivors and 10 healthy children were matched by sex, age, and Tanner stage. Participants completed a submaximal incremental exercise test to determine their fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates. Results The relative oxygen volume (VO2) peak was significantly higher in the control group than in the survivors of childhood brain tumors (43.3 +/- 11.9 and 32.4 +/- 10.2 mL/kg /min, P = .04). At the same relative exercise intensity, there was no difference in the carbohydrate or lipid oxidation rate between the two groups, or in the maximal fat oxidation (MFO) rate, or in the heart rate or percentage of VO2 peak to reach MFO. Healthy children achieved MFO at significantly higher muscular power than did brain tumor survivors (47.9 +/- 20.8 and 21.8 +/- 9.6 W, P = .003). Conclusion Because child brain tumor survivors are less physically fit than healthy children, and substrate utilization during submaximal exercise is not different, physical activity should be promoted for child brain tumor survivors.

The amplitude of seasonality decreases with depth and is much larger in temperature and density than in salinity. Time series of temperature and salinity are correlated in the surface but not in the bottom layer. Trends in temperature are large (up to 0.6 degrees C over 10 years), significant through the area, and not sensitive to the sampling interval and time series length. In contrast, trends in salinity are largely small and insignificant and depend on the time series length. The warming of the area is more during spring and summer. Such large temperature trends and their spatial variability emphasize the importance of maintaining regular long-term observations for the proper estimation of thermohaline trends and their variability. This is particularly important in regions which are key for driving thermohaline circulation such as the northern Adriatic, with the potential to affect biogeochemical and ecological properties of the whole Adriatic Sea.

Dissolved rare earth elements distribution in the Solomon Sea								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				524				11	36		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.05.012			OCT 5 2019	2019	Trace Elements and Isotopes (TEIs) were measured as part of the GEOTRACES PANDORA cruise (July-August 2012, R/V L'Atalante), among them Rare Earth Elements (REEs) as pertinent tracers of land-ocean inputs and water mass transformations. This work discusses results of 19 dissolved REE (dREE) profiles measured using a trispike method in the Coral Sea and inside and at the exits of the Solomon Sea, a semi-enclosed sea with complex topography and straits. Overall, dREEs -except the insoluble Ce- show nutrient like profiles, i.e. depleted at the surface and enriched at depth. Illustrative Nd concentrations range from similar to 5 pmol/kg at the surface to > 25 pmol/kg at 5000 m depth. However, local dREE enrichments are observed, mostly in the Straits (Indispensable, Solomon and Vitiaz Straits) and along the island coasts. A box model allows calculating and discussing the fate of the dREEs in the different water layers flowing through the Solomon Sea. Finally, subtle variations revealed by La, Ce, Eu anomalies and the normalized light versus heavy REE ratio (expressed as Nd-n/Yb-n) allows the identification of specific mechanisms affecting the distribution of the different dREEs. The positive Eu anomaly observed in the surface layers reflects the basaltic origin of external inputs, consistent with the intensive weathering and/or volcanic activity affecting the surrounding islands. These data also confirm that the distributions of heavy dREEs (like Yb) are better correlated to the dSi concentrations than that of the other REEs.

Periodic trains of Lorentzian pulses have been shown to induce minimal excitations without creating additional electron-hole pairs in a single non-interacting 1D electron channel. The presence of electron-electron (e-e) interactions dramatically affects the non-equilibrium dynamics of a 1D system. Here, we consider the intrinsic spectral properties of a helical liquid, with a pair of counterpropagating interacting channels, in the presence of time-dependent Lorentzian voltage pulses. We show that peculiar asymmetries in the behavior of the spectral function are induced by interactions, depending on the sign of the injected charges. Moreover, we discuss the robustness of the concept of minimal excitations in the presence of interactions, where the link with excess noise is no more straightforward. Finally, we propose a scanning tunneling microscope setup to spectroscopically access and probe the non-equilibrium behavior induced by the voltage drive and e-e interactions. This allows a diagnosis of fractional charges in a correlated quantum spin Hall liquid in the presence of time-dependent drives.

From a methodological point of view, the paper follows previous work on urban hierarchies. The paper's results show that the European structural mechanisms and policies have been rather efficient until 2008 and have allowed the convergence of regional GDPS. The less developed regions' GDP increases faster than the GDP of other regions during this period. Nevertheless, this process changes after 2008 and the European mechanisms of convergence don't seem to work after this period. After 2008, the inequalities in regional GDP per capita seem to grow again which leads to a two-speed Europe.

We propose a model, inspired by new approaches of the Economic Base Model, applied to French urban areas over the period 1999-2013 from a decomposition of employment in metropolitan, productive and presential functions, based on the functional classification established by INSEE. We consider that the evolution of employment in urban areas can be attributed to three driving forces: the metropolitan functions, representative of the human capital and productivity effects, the productive activities, largely exporting, and the external revenues (public, residential and social) received. In the case of France, we verify the concentration of metropolitan functions and the unequal development of employment in favor of large urban areas with more than 200,000 jobs. We show the determining role of the rise of metropolitan functions in the employment growth of large urban areas, and the double facet of the process of metropolisation between Paris and large urban areas.

The Ionomer n(c) Analysis (INCA method), based on n(c)/T plots where n(c) is a counter elastic force index, was applied to SSC-PFSA in order to evaluate ionomer thermo-mechanical properties and to probe the increase of crystallinity during the annealing procedure. The enhanced thermal and mechanical stability of extruded Aquivion (R) 870 (equivalent weight, EW = 870 g.mol(-1)) was related to an increase of long-range order. Complementary differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements confirmed the increase of polymer stiffness by the annealing treatment with an enhancement of the storage modulus over the whole range of temperature. The main thermomechanical relaxation temperature is also enhanced. DSC measurements showed slight base line changes after annealing, attributable to the glass transition and melting of a small amount of crystalline phase. The difference between the glass transition and melting temperatures derived from INCA plots and the ionic-cluster transition temperature derived from DMA measurements is consistent with the different experimental conditions, especially the dry atmosphere in DMA. Finally, the annealing procedure was also successfully applied for the first time to an un-crystallized cast membrane (EW = 830 g.mol(-1)) resulting in a remarkable mechanical and thermal stabilization.

Soil studies have investigated the potential microbial colonization and remineralization of BC particles, but this process has been seldom studied in marine waters. BC provides a significant input of organic carbon to the oceans, yet its fate and role in biogeochemical cycling remains unknown. Here we explored the microbial colonization of BC particles in coastal seawater samples collected in Halong Bay (northern Vietnam). Using high-resolution mass spectrometry and microscopy methods, we observed an increasing colonization of BC particles by marine microbes in the presence of amino acids. Our results suggest that natural organic matter (NOM) present in seawater may promote the microbial colonization and eventual remineralization of BC particles. Future experiments should explore the potential microbial remineralization of BC particles to unveil the role of this massive source of carbon to marine ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Namely, we show that ( divide E(G)|/ divide V(G) divide )<= left ceiling 2max{dens(G1), horizontal ellipsis ,dens(Gm)} right ceiling log divide V(G) divide , where dens(H) is the maximum ratio divide E(H ') divide / divide V(H ') divide taken over all subgraphs H ' of H. We introduce the notions of VC-dimension VC-dim(G) and VC-density VC-dens(G) of a subgraph G of a Cartesian product G1MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISGm, generalizing the classical Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of set-families (viewed as subgraphs of hypercubes). We prove that if G1, horizontal ellipsis ,Gm belong to the class G(H) of all finite connected graphs not containing a given graph H as a minor, then for any subgraph G of G1MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISGm the sharper inequality ( divide E(G) divide / divide V(G) divide )<=mu(H).VC-dim*(G) holds, where mu(H) is the supremum of the densities of the graphs from G(H). We refine and sharpen these two results to several specific graph classes. We also derive upper bounds (some of them polylogarithmic) for the size of adjacency labeling schemes of subgraphs of Cartesian products.

Although it is assumed that most marine plastics are transported from land to the ocean through rivers, only limited data on riverine plastic transport exists. Recently, new methods have been introduced to characterize riverine plastics consistently through time and space. For example, combining visual counting observations and plastic debris sampling can provide order of magnitude estimations of plastic transport through a river. In this paper, we present findings from multi-season measurement campaign in the Saigon River, Vietnam. For the first time, we demonstrate that macroplastic transport exhibits strong temporal variation. The monthly averaged plastic transport changes up to a factor five within the measurement period. As it is unclear what drives the variation in plastic transport, relations between rainfall, river discharge, presence of organic material and plastic transport have been explored. Furthermore, we present new findings on the cross-sectional and vertical distribution of riverine plastic transport. With this paper we present new insights in the origin and fate of riverine plastic transport, emphasizing the severity of the emerging thread of plastic pollution on riverine ecosystems.

Strain building and correlation with grain nucleation during silicon growth								ACTA MATERIALIA				177				141	150		10.1016/j.actamat.2019.07.035			SEP 15 2019	2019	This work is dedicated to the grain structure formation in silicon ingots with a particular focus on the crystal structure strain building and its implication in new grain nucleation process. The implied mechanisms are investigated by advanced in situ X-ray imaging techniques during silicon directional solidification. It is shown that the grain structure formation is mainly driven by Sigma 3 <111> twin nucleation. Grain competition phenomena occurring during the growth process lead to the creation of higher order twin boundaries, localised strained areas and associated crystal structure deformation. On the one hand, it is demonstrated that local strain building can be directly related to the characteristics of the twin boundaries created during silicon growth due to grain competition. On the other hand, space restriction due to competition during growth can be at the origin of local strain building as well. Finally, the accumulation of all these factors generating strain is responsible for spontaneous new grain nucleation. When occurring, both grain nucleation and subsequent grain structure reorganisation contribute to lower the strain in the growing ingot. It is demonstrated as well that the local distribution of the strained areas created during silicon growth is retrieved after cooling down, from melting temperature to room temperature, on top of an additional larger scale deformation of the sample due to the cooling down only.

J	Vitari, Claudio; Raguseo, Elisabetta								Big data analytics business value and firm performance: linking with environmental context								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH				58	18			5456	5476		10.1080/00207543.2019.1660822			SEP 16 2020	2020	Previous studies, grounded on the resource based view, have already explored the relationship between the business value that Big Data Analytics (BDA) can bring to firm performance. However, the role played by the environmental characteristics in which companies operate has not been investigated in the literature. We inform the theory, in that direction, via the integration of the contingency theory to the resource based view theory of the firm. This original and integrative model examines the moderating influence of environmental features on the relationship between BDA business value and firm performance. The combination of survey data and secondary financial data on a representative sample of medium and large companies makes possible the statistical validation of our research model. The results offer evidence that BDA business value leads to higher firm performance, namely financial performance, market performance and customer satisfaction. More original is the demonstration that this relationship is stronger in munificent environments, while the dynamism of the environment does not have any moderating effect on the performance of BDA solutions. It means that managers working for firms in markets with a growing demand are in the best position to profit from BDA.

Maximal force exertion and upper-limb posture were measured with a force sensor embedded in a handbrake and an optoelectronic system, respectively. Eleven subjects participated in the experiment which consisted of exerting the maximal force in isometric conditions considering five hand brake positions relative to the seat H-point. Then, maximal force was predicted by the force feasible set obtained from an upper-limb musculoskeletal model. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the angle between measured and predicted forces was 8.4 degrees while the RMS error (RMSE) for amplitude prediction was 95.4 N. However, predicted, and measured force amplitudes were highly correlated (r = 0.88, p < 0.05, slope = 0.97, intercept = 73.3N) attesting the capacity of the model to predict force exertion according to the subject's posture. The implications in the framework of ergonomics are then discussed. Practitioner summary: Maximal force exertion is of paramount importance in digital human modelling. We used the force feasible set formalism to predict maximal force exertion during handbraking from posture and anthropometric data. The predicted and measured force orientation showed a RMS of 8.4 degrees while amplitude presented a RMSE of 95.4 N with a strong correlation (r = 0.88, p < 0.05, slope 0.97, intercept 77.3 N).

Elemental composition, (atomic) structure, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical performance related to the oxygen reduction were investigated for electrodes carbonised in the range from 300 degrees C to 1400 degrees C. Chemical and structural properties were analysed using elemental analysis, XPS, SEM, and Raman spectroscopy; electrical conductivities of the fibre networks were examined by four-point probe measurements. Electrochemical properties were evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry in 6 M KOH by the open circuit potentials, the cathodic current densities at given overpotentials, and required overpotentials at given current densities. The highest current density was obtained from fibres carbonised at 850 degrees C. The connection between the fibre characteristics and electrochemical properties are discussed, highlighting the importance of the nitrogen bonding state. The results provide a base for thedevelopment of high performance air electrodes.

After revisiting the classical case, we consider several generalizations in which the space of matrices under study carries an action of a compact Lie group, and the goal is to describe an associated probability measure on the space of orbits. We review some recent results about the problem of computing the probability density via orbital integrals and about the locus of singularities of the density. We discuss some relations with representation theory, combinatorics, pictographs and symmetric polynomials, and we also include some novel remarks in connection with Schur's problem.

Hence, it facilitated project implementation, raising issues and reducing risks of not implementing SSC on time and within the planned conditions. Applying the Action-Research methodology and after investigating the conditions and resistance to be overcome in each country, the working team has identified the need to develop a change management plan. The main objective was to get the support and commitment from leaders and engage employees to retain existing business knowledge, therefore not impacting project's deadlines. The plan implementation, led by the working team has identified and has treated resistance, empowered local leaders as change agents, make clear employees' questions and, thus, assured the project implementation on time and within the planned conditions.

Among the points of the reform, for the collective plans, employers are required to provide their employees with a basket of preventive care. Its content, enacted by the Ministry of Health, includes contraceptive care. The Ministry of Health has dismissed contraceptive care by religious employers in the strict sense, such as churches, and eventually non-profit religious organizations, including universities and hospitals. But these exemptions will not prevent an outcry from the Catholic episcopate, which denounces the contraceptive mandate as an attack on religious freedom. Some bishops call for civil disobedience. They were soon joined by many evangelical organizations, making a common cause to defend the right for Christians to religious objection when the law is conflicting with their conscience. It concerns of course the contraceptive mandate but includes logically the legality of abortion and same sex marriage. Since 2010, several US states, thanks to Republican majorities, have adopted or tried to adopt bills protecting religious freedom as including religious objection in case of conscience conflicts with the law. This article will focus on highlighting the roots of conscious objection in the American religious context and its current direction. It will make an initial assessment of its legal and judicial results.

Swift heavy ions generated from a cyclotron were used to irradiate polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer film of thickness 23 mu m to create latent tracks which were then chemically etched in an alkaline solution, to produce track-etched membrane. Magnetron sputtering was then used to deposite titanium (Ti) on the membrane to produce PET-TM with Ti thickness of (similar to)45 nm. Polyamide 6 nanofibres (PA6-nfs) or polyacrylonitrile nanofibres (PAN-nfs) were directly electrospun upon the Ti coated PET-TM using an electrospinning process. The average fibre diameter of PA6-nfs or PAN-nfs was 52 +/- 9.8 nm or 354 +/- 40 nm, respectively. The track-etched membrane, the nanofibres and the novel composite membrane were characterised using SEM, TEM, TGA, ATR-FTIR and adsorption/desorption of nitrogen techniques. The results confirmed the fabrication of nanofibre coated track-etched composite membrane.

The overall idea is to mimic the functioning of natural reef-lagoon systems in which the cross-reef pressure gradient induced by wave breaking is able to drive an outward flow through the pass. The objective is to estimate the feasibility of a positive energy breakwater, combining the usual wave-sheltering function of immersed breakwater together with the production of renewable energy by turbines. A series of numerical simulations is performed using a depth-averaged model to understand the effects of each geometrical reef parameter on the reef-lagoon hydrodynamics. A synthetic wave and tide climate is then imposed to estimate the potential power production. An annual production between 50 and 70 MWh is estimated.

The method is applied to evaluate rotordynamic response of an automotive turbocharger, modeled as rigid rotor, and of a turbine-generator shaft train for power generation modeled as flexible rotor through the transient transfer matrix method. The methodology claims to render drastically faster evaluation of transient response of rotating systems with nonlinear bearings regardless the complexity of the bearing models implemented. The computational time of transient response is similar to this when short bearing expressions are used. Turbocharger rotordynamic simulation considers the use of nonlinear bearing models as mandatory, and several case studies have to be performed for the definition of key design parameters of floating ring bearings. The bearing database method offers the tool for a severe total time reduction in rotordynamic calculations, with the possibility to implement advanced thermohydrodynamic bearing models to the rotordynamic algorithm as fast as short bearing approximation formulas. Furthermore, the rotordynamic design of large turbine shaft trains is still based on linear harmonic analysis which leads to conservative designs. The database method aims to include the transient response of nonlinear rotor models as a standard procedure in the rotordynamic design of large shaft trains, which nowadays is avoided due to high time cost and complexity.

The LC-MS-based metabolomics and 16S rDNA metabarcoding data sets were integrated in a multivariate meta-omics analysis (multi-block PLS-DA from the MixOmic DIABLO analysis) showing a strong seasonal covariation (Mantel test: p < 0.01). A network based on positive and negative correlations between the two data sets revealed two clusters of variables, one relative to the 'spring period' and a second to the 'summer period'. The 'spring period' cluster was mainly characterized by dipeptides positively correlated with a single bacterial taxon of the Alteromonadaceae family (BD1-7 clade). Moreover, 'summer' dominant epibacterial taxa from the second cluster (including Erythrobacteraceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Oceanospirillaceae and Flammeovirgaceae) showed positive correlations with few metabolites known as macroalgal antifouling defences [e.g. dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) and proline] which exhibited a key role within the correlation network. Despite a core community that represents a significant part of the total epibacteria, changes in the microbiota structure associated with surface metabolome variations suggested that both environment and algal host shape the bacterial surface microbiota.

J	Benderbal, Hichem Haddou; Benyoucef, Lyes								Machine layout design problem under product family evolution in reconfigurable manufacturing environment: a two-phase-based AMOSA approach								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				104	1-4			375	389		10.1007/s00170-019-03865-1			SEP 2019	2019	Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) are designed to manufacture a specific product, incorporating the scalability to other products in the same family. This ability is based primarily on the reconfiguration capabilities offered by reconfigurable machines tools (RMTs). This paper addresses one of the most important aspects related to the reactivity of RMSs. More specifically, it considers the relations, which link the conceived system with two important environments: its logical environment, i.e., the product family (products that share similarities) in which the RMS can evolve, and its physical environment, i.e., the physical workshop that implements this RMS. We study the machine layout problem by considering the product family evolution where two sub-problems are addressed. The first sub-problem concerns the evolution of the product, in the same family, towards new products to meet the evolutions and the requirements of the customers. The second sub-problem deals with the machine layout problem based on the results of the first sub-problem. For this, our two-phase-based approach combines the well-known metaheuristic, archived multi-objective simulated annealing (AMOSA), with an exhaustive search-based heuristic to determine the best machine layout for all the selected machines of the product family. The developed approach is based on the initially generated process plans of products (in the product family) for the RMS design under performance metrics. Moreover, the proposed layout must, at its best, respect both the constraints imposed by the generated process plans and those depicting the available location in the shop floor where machines can be placed. An illustrative numerical example is proposed to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.

Observations of drifting specimens, collected in March 2015 and March and April 2017, suggest that this non-indigenous species has reached Algerian waters. However, S. muticum cannot yet be considered established since the collected seaweeds were not fixed to substrata. were not fertile, and there was no evidence of colonization. Potential vectors of spread for S. muticum into the area include shipping, oyster farming and ocean circulation. In the future, intensive survey and monitoring actions are needed to detect any fertile or attached fronds.

Even though many monographs exist devoted to this theory, the different tools needed (e.g. representation theory, harmonic analysis, recoupling theory...) are often dispersed in different books, with different conventions and notations. This was the initial motivation for the compilation of the present document. Generally, these notes can serve three main purposes: a concise introduction for students to the essential mathematical tools of LQG, a convenient compendium for researchers, a translational hub between the conventions of the main references. These notes are aimed both at physicists, caring about their tools being mathematically well grounded, and at mathematicians, curious about how some of their familiar abstract structures can reveal the beauty of quantum gravity.

We show that the localisation length for these Balanced Random Quantum Walks can be expressed as a combinatorial expression involving sums over weighted paths on the considered graph. This expression provides lower bounds on the localisation length by restriction to paths with weight 1, which allows us to prove the localisation length diverges on the tree as d(2). On the cubic lattice, the method yields the lower bound 1/ln(2) for all d and allows us to bound the localisation length from below by the correlation length of self-avoiding walks computed at 1/(2d).

Effective concentrations (EC50) of AS162 at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h were, respectively, of 4.3, 4.4, and 6.0 mu M. When tested in combination with HSLs, results showed that quorum-sensing signal molecules 3-oxo-C6 and 3-oxo-C8 homoserine lactones do not act directly on the biofilm formation, but are able to interfere positively with AS162 to promote biofilm growth with EC50 ranging from 30 to 50 mu M. The same results were obtained with two other marine bacterial strains: Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica TC8 and Paracoccus sp. 4M6. These findings suggest that HSLs can significantly affect the biocidal sensitivity of marine bacteria to antifouling agents.

Decadal shifts of coastal microphytoplankton communities in a semi-enclosed bay of NW Mediterranean Sea subjected to multiple stresses								ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				224				171	186		10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.049			AUG 31 2019	2019	Long-term evolution of microphytoplankton communities remains poorly studied in anthropized coastal zones submitted to multiple stressors. Here, we investigate decadal (2005-2017) microphytoplankton community changes, focusing on abundance and biovolume of major taxa related to both local abiotic conditions (rainfall rate, temperature and salinity) and regional convection events (wintering deep mixing) in the highly urbanized and semi-enclosed Toulon Bay (NW Mediterranean Sea). Results showed that persistent variations in local rainfall regime were followed by major changes in microphytoplankton community composition. Wet period (P-2) (increase of wintering precipitations observed between late 2008 and early 2015) was associated to an increase of large heterotrophic dinoflagellates and disappearance of dominant diatom taxa, while dry periods (2005-2008 (P-1) and 2015-2017 (P-3)) promoted diatoms, microflagellates and small mixotrophic/heterotrophic dinoflagellates including potentially toxic species. Concomitance between intense deep mixing events, reported in open Ligurian Basin (particularly during winters 2005 and 2006) and higher values in the total microphytoplankton abundance and in spring diatom abundance regardless of rainfall conditions, presents this meso-scale process as the main fertilization mechanism in Toulon Bay. Although no change was detected in the chlorophyll a concentration during the 2006-2017 period, its trend was negatively correlated to the total microphytoplankton abundance. This negative relation as well as a change of size in dinoflagellates suggested a shift in the primary producer nature, from large autotrophic cells (diatoms and microflagellates) to smaller ones, driven by a runoff intensification. Finally, different communities composition were observed during both dry periods (i.e. diatoms-dominated and autotrophic microflagellate-dominated communities during P-1 and P-3, respectively), suggesting another environmental driver of change for phytoplankton communities of this coastal ecosystem.

The restriction Lambda(T)(S, R) corresponds to the case where the Dirichlet traces are supported on (0, T) x S and the Neumann traces are restricted on (0, T) x R. Here S and R are open sets, which may be disjoint, on the boundary of M. We show that Lambda(T)(S, R) determines uniquely, up the natural gauge invariance, the lower order terms A and q in a neighborhood of the set R assuming that R is strictly convex and that the wave equation is exactly controllable from S in time T/2. We give also a global result under a convex foliation condition. The main novelty is the recovery of A and q when the sets R and S are disjoint. We allow A and q to be non-self-adjoint, and in particular, the corresponding physical system may have dissipation of energy. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we present evidence that the conventional framework for the subpolar Southern Ocean carbon cycle, which attributes a dominant role to the vertical overturning circulation and shelf-sea processes, fundamentally misrepresents the drivers of regional carbon uptake. Observations in the Weddell Gyre-a key representative region of the subpolar Southern Ocean-show that the rate of carbon uptake is set by an interplay between the Gyre's horizontal circulation and the remineralization at mid-depths of organic carbon sourced from biological production in the central gyre. These results demonstrate that reframing the carbon cycle of the subpolar Southern Ocean is an essential step to better define its role in past and future climate change.

A global compilation of phosphate measured using high-sensitivity methods revealed several previously unrecognized low-phosphate areas and clear regional differences. Both observational climatologies and Earth system models (ESMs) systematically overestimated surface phosphate. Furthermore, ESMs misrepresented the relationships between phosphate, phytoplankton biomass, and primary productivity. Atmospheric iron input and nitrogen fixation are known important controls on surface phosphate, but model simulations showed that differences in the iron-to-macronutrient ratio in the vertical nutrient supply and surface lateral transport are additional drivers of phosphate concentrations. Our study demonstrates the importance of accurately quantifying nutrients for understanding the regulation of ocean ecosystems and biogeochemistry now and under future climate conditions.

Focusing on the cases of a cosine and Lorentzian periodic drive, we show that the different symmetries of the photo-assisted tunneling amplitudes strongly affect the overall profile of these quantities as a function of the AC and DC voltage contributions, which can be tuned independently in experiments.

Heterostructures, obtained by a combination of different semiconductor nanomaterials with different band energies, have been extensively studied in order to enhance their gas-sensing performance. In this context, our present study focuses on the investigation of chemiresistive-sensing capabilities of a combination of TiO2 nanoparticles and V2O5 nanowires obtained via hydrothermal treatment of the peroxometal complex. The formation of V2O5/TiO2 heterostructures was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. This study also proposes an efficient approach to produce 1D V2O5/TiO2 heterostructures with a good range of detection (0.09-1.25 ppm) and remarkable ozone-sensing properties related to repeatability and selectivity.

The experiment was performed at a temperature of 400 K under continuous gas flow conditions of pure Ar and Ar/CO mixtures. The nanoparticle was preselected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and postanalyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We obtain a very good agreement between the overall nanoparticle size, shape, and defect structure as determined by CXDI and AFM. In addition, we compare the strain state in the nanoparticle near surface region and its bulk: For pure Ar flow, we find a slight compressive strain in the nanoparticle bulk compared to an expansion in the near surface region. We ascribe the latter to the presence of high index vicinal surfaces. Our analysis suggests that under mixed Ar/CO flow at 400 K reshaping of the nanoparticle occurred. New high index facets developed, leading to a stronger lattice expansion, also propagating into the nanoparticle bulk. Our high-resolution experiments pave the way for future CXDI experiments under operando catalytic reaction conditions.

The purpose of this article is to make the first step towards computing vertex amplitudes with the use of quantum algorithms. In our studies we are focused on a vertex amplitude of 3+1 D gravity, associated with a pentagram spin network. Furthermore, all spin labels of the spin network are assumed to be equal j=1/2, which is crucial for the introduction of the intertwiner qubits. A procedure of determining modulus squares of vertex amplitudes on universal quantum computers is proposed. Utility of the approach is tested with the use of: IBM's ibmqx4 5-qubit quantum computer, simulator of quantum computer provided by the same company and QX quantum computer simulator. Finally, values of the vertex probability are determined employing both the QX and the IBM simulators with 20-qubit quantum register and compared with analytical predictions.

The field instrumentation, which consists in a cross-shore network of pressure sensors and one high resolution velocity profiler, has been deployed for more than two months over the Guano reef barrier, New Caledonia. The combined analysis of observations and numerical simulations shows that the reef barrier acts as an efficient, but depth-dependent, filter for incoming wave energy. The data analysis reveals the presence of very low frequency standing wave patterns due to reflection either at the reef barrier inner boundary or at the lagoon shore. Another striking feature is the development of undular bore trains over the reef flat.

However, the influence of processing parameters on these mechanisms and their interactions is still not fully understood. This is particularly the case for Dual-Phase steels having an initial cold-rolled microstructure consisting of ferrite and martensite before annealing, which were scarcely investigated compared to ferrite-pearlite initial microstructures. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments together with post-mortem metallo-graphic analysis allowed clarifying both ferrite recrystallization and austenite formation during annealing of a ferrite-martensite initial microstructure depending on the process parameters of the annealing cycle. Results showed a major influence of recrystallization state on austenite formation, leading to an unexpected effect of heating rate on austenite formation kinetics. A modeling approach was undertaken to rationalize the influence of heating rate on austenite formation by taking into account the bi-phased ferrite-martensite initial microstructure and the effect of ferrite recrystallization state.

A systematic review and meta-analysis								PEDIATRIC RESEARCH				86	2			149	156		10.1038/s41390-019-0409-5			AUG 2019	2019	BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is essential for children throughout their growth and maturation. It improves physiological and psychological health and limits the risk of developing metabolic disorders. However, some chronic physiological and metabolic diseases may lead to decreased PA. The diversity of outcomes in the literature offers no consensus for physical activity and sedentary levels in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A literature review and a meta-analysis were carried out with original studies from a Medline database search. Only high-quality studies (STROBE checklist) written in English comparing PA level or sedentary behavior (SB) between children with the disorders and their healthy peers were considered. The aim was to examine PA and SB in children with JIA or IBD compared to their healthy peers. RESULTS: The literature review and meta-analysis identified decreased PA and increased time spent in SB in these populations, which may exacerbate both their lower physical fitness and the symptoms of their health disorders. CONCLUSION: Results nevertheless show discrepancies due to the different materials and methods used and the variables measured. Further studies are needed to establish a gold standard method for assessing PA level in these populations.

The proteins secreted into seawater may play a crucial role in maintaining this dinoflagellate in these ecosystems, but this possibility has never been investigated before. In this study, the A. catenella secretome was predicted from its transcriptome by combining several bioinformatics tools. Our results predict a secretome of 2 779 proteins, among which 79% contain less than 500 amino acids, suggesting that most secreted proteins are short in length. The predicted secretome includes 963 proteins (35%) with Pfam domains: 773 proteins with one Pfam domain and 190 proteins with two or more Pfam domains. Their functional annotation showed that they are mainly involved in (i) proteolysis, (ii) stress responses and (iii) primary metabolism. In addition, 47% of the secreted proteins appear to be enzymes, primarily peptidases, known to be biologically active in the extracellular medium during stress responses. Finally, this study provides a wealth of candidates of proteins secreted by A. catenella, which may interact with the marine environment and help this dinoflagellate develop in various environmental conditions.

Based on the use of the concept of decay rate in the quadratic Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions for designing fuzzy SOF control are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, the proposed method overcomes the drawback of the iterative algorithms based on LMI approach, and does not need any equality constraints; in addition, it can provide less conservative results. In the end, numerical and practical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We tested different immersion modes (dynamic, cyclic and static) in Toulon Bay (north-western Mediterranean Sea; NWMS). The static mode was also compared between Toulon and Banyuls Bays. In addition, different artificial surfaces designed to hamper cell attachment (self-polishing coating: SPC; and fouling-release coating: FRC) were compared to inert plastic. Prokaryotic community composition was affected by immersion mode, surface characteristics and site. Rhodobacteriaceae and Flavobacteriaceae dominated the biofilm community structure, with distinct genera according to surface type or immersion mode. Cell density increased with time, greatly limited by hydrodynamic forces, and supposed to delay biofilm maturation. After 1 year, a significant impact of shear stress on the taxonomic structure of the prokaryotic community developed on each surface type was observed. When surfaces contained no biocides, roughness and wettability shaped prokaryotic community structure, which was not enhanced by shear stress. Conversely, the biocidal effect of SPC surfaces, already major in static immersion mode, was amplified by the 15 knots speed. The biofilm community on SPC was 60% dissimilar to the biofilm on the other surfaces and was distinctly colonized by Sphingomonadaceae ((Alter)Erythrobacter). At Banyuls, prokaryotic community structures were more similar between the four surfaces tested than at Toulon, due possibly to a masking effect of environmental constraints, especially hydrodynamic, which was greater than in Toulon. Finally, predicted functions such as cell adhesion confirmed some of the hypotheses drawn regarding biofilm formation over the artificial surfaces tested here.		[Catao, Elisa C.

The obtained powders were structurally characterized using thermal analyses and a combined XRD with Rietveld refinement. Their morphological and growth mechanisms were followed by SEM during the maturation phase. The results showed a square/rectangular shape and pseudospherical morphology, which exhibited a monoclinic phase after calcination at 400 degrees C and an orthorhombic phase after calcination at 500 degrees C. The temperature treatment induced an increase of grain size for the NP lateral size, while the PS size remains temperature independent. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue under solar light irradiation. The degradation process was investigated by studying the photosensitive properties, optical absorption, photoluminescence and photoresistance. The photodegradation activity of methylene blue is composed of a rapid and strong adsorption step followed by a photoinduced catalytic process. The PS sample revealed a higher adsorption rate than NP powders at the low calcination temperature, while the photoinduced catalysis is better at the high calcination temperature, reaching 88% at 500 degrees C. The photosensitive properties showed a low luminescence intensity and a long charge carrier recombination time, thus indicating the photocatalytic efficiency of the elaborated samples.

Following the observation made by Bianchi and Rovelli (Phys Rev D 84:027502, 2011) we explore the relationship between the Planck scale discreteness of the Hubble horizon and deformations of the symmetry of rotations. We show that the so-called q-deformations in a natural way lead to a mechanism of condensation in the very early Universe. We argue that this provides a possible resolution of the problem of the initial homogeneity at the onset of inflation. Furthermore, we perform an analysis in terms of entropy of the quantum Hubble horizon and show that the Lambda CDM model may arise from a linearly corrected Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (that is, linearly in area of the horizon). Based on this, we show that the current accelerating expansion can be associated with the entropy decrease in the Hubble volume. The results presented open new ways to explore the relation between the Planck scale effects and observationally relevant features of our Universe.

In a previous paper, we showed that QWs over the honeycomb and triangular lattices can be used to simulate the Dirac equation. We apply a spacetime coordinate transformation upon the lattice of this QW, and show that it is equivalent to introducing spacetime-dependent local unitaries-whilst keeping the lattice fixed. By exploiting this duality between changes in geometry, and changes in local unitaries, we show that the spacetime-dependent QW simulates the Dirac equation in (2 + 1)-dimensional curved spacetime. Interestingly, the duality crucially relies on the non linear-independence of the three preferred directions of the honeycomb and triangular lattices: The same construction would fail for the square lattice. At the practical level, this result opens the possibility to simulate field theories on curved manifolds, via the quantum walk on different kinds of lattices.

Integrative therapies combining physical activity and dietary counseling are recommended; however to date no large randomized controlled trial has been conducted during adjuvant therapy. The Adapted Physical Activity and Diet (APAD) intervention was evaluated for its ability to decrease fatigue (primary outcome), anxiety, depression, body mass index (BMI), and fat mass, and enhance muscular and cognitive performances, and quality-of-life (QoL).MethodsWomen diagnosed with early breast cancer (N=143, mean age=5210years) were randomized to APAD or usual care (UC). APAD included thrice-weekly moderate-intensity mixed aerobic and resistance exercise sessions and 9 dietetic consultations. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and anthropometric, muscular, and cognitive variables were measured at baseline, 18weeks (end of chemotherapy), and 26weeks (end of radiotherapy and intervention), and at 6- and 12-month post-intervention follow-ups. Multi-adjusted linear mixed-effects models were used to compare groups over time.ResultsSignificant beneficial effects of the APAD intervention were observed on all PROs (i.e., fatigue, QoL, anxiety, depression) at 18 and 26weeks. The significant effect on fatigue and QoL persisted up to 12-month follow-up. Significant decreases in BMI, fat mass, and increased muscle endurance and cognitive flexibility were observed at 26weeks, but did not persist afterward. Leisure physical activity was enhanced in the APAD group vs UC group at 18 and 26weeks. No significant effect of the intervention was found on major macronutrients intake.ConclusionsA combined diet and exercise intervention during chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with early breast cancer led to positive changes in a range of psychological, physiological and behavioral outcomes at the end of intervention. A beneficial effect persisted on fatigue and QoL at long term, i.e., 1year post-intervention. Diet-exercise supportive care should be integrated into the management of early breast cancer patients.Trial registration The APAD study was prospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01495650; date of registration: December 20, 2011).

The etiology of DCS has highlighted thrombotic and inflammatory phenomena that could cause severe neurological disorders or even death. Given the immunomodulatory effects described for minocycline, an antibiotic in widespread use, we have decided to explore its effects in an experimental model for decompression sickness. 40 control mice (Ctrl) and 40 mice treated orally with 90 mg/kg of minocycline (MINO) were subjected to a protocol in a hyperbaric chamber, compressed with air. The purpose was to mimic a scuba dive to a depth of 90 msw and its pathogenic decompression phase. Clinical examinations and blood counts were conducted after the return to the surface. For the first time they were completed by a simple infrared (IR) imaging technique in order to assess feasibility and its clinical advantage in differentiating the sick mice (DCS) from the healthy mice (NoDCS). In this tudy, exposure to the hyperbaric protocol provoked a reduction in the number of circulating leukocytes. DCS in mice, manifesting itself by paralysis or convulsion for example, is also associated with a fall in platelets count. Cold areas (< 25 degrees C) were detected by IR in the hind paws and tail with significant differences (p < 0.05) between DCS and NoDCS. Severe hypothermia was also shown in the DCS mice. The ROC analysis of the thermograms has made it possible to determine that an average tail temperature below 27.5 degrees C allows us to consider the animals to be suffering from DCS (OR = 8; AUC = 0.754, p = 0.0018). Minocycline modulates blood analysis and it seems to limit the mobilization of monocytes and granulocytes after the provocative dive. While a higher proportion of mice treated with minocycline experienced DCS symptoms, there is no significant difference. The infrared imaging has made it possible to show severe hypothermia. It suggests an modification of thermregulation in DCS animals. Surveillance by infrared camera is fast and it can aid the prognosis in the case of decompression sickness in mice.

The lichen symbiosis re-viewed through the genomes of Cladonia grayi and its algal partner Asterochloris glomerata								BMC GENOMICS				20						605	10.1186/s12864-019-5629-x			JUL 23 2019	2019	BackgroundLichens, encompassing 20,000 known species, are symbioses between specialized fungi (mycobionts), mostly ascomycetes, and unicellular green algae or cyanobacteria (photobionts). Here we describe the first parallel genomic analysis of the mycobiont Cladonia grayi and of its green algal photobiont Asterochloris glomerata. We focus on genes/predicted proteins of potential symbiotic significance, sought by surveying proteins differentially activated during early stages of mycobiont and photobiont interaction in coculture, expanded or contracted protein families, and proteins with differential rates of evolution.ResultsA) In coculture, the fungus upregulated small secreted proteins, membrane transport proteins, signal transduction components, extracellular hydrolases and, notably, a ribitol transporter and an ammonium transporter, and the alga activated DNA metabolism, signal transduction, and expression of flagellar components. B) Expanded fungal protein families include heterokaryon incompatibility proteins, polyketide synthases, and a unique set of G-protein alpha subunit paralogs. Expanded algal protein families include carbohydrate active enzymes and a specific subclass of cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrases. The alga also appears to have acquired by horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes novel archaeal ATPases and Desiccation-Related Proteins. Expanded in both symbionts are signal transduction components, ankyrin domain proteins and transcription factors involved in chromatin remodeling and stress responses. The fungal transportome is contracted, as are algal nitrate assimilation genes. C) In the mycobiont, slow-evolving proteins were enriched for components involved in protein translation, translocation and sorting.ConclusionsThe surveyed genes affect stress resistance, signaling, genome reprogramming, nutritional and structural interactions. The alga carries many genes likely transferred horizontally through viruses, yet we found no evidence of inter-symbiont gene transfer. The presence in the photobiont of meiosis-specific genes supports the notion that sexual reproduction occurs in Asterochloris while they are free-living, a phenomenon with implications for the adaptability of lichens and the persistent autonomy of the symbionts. The diversity of the genes affecting the symbiosis suggests that lichens evolved by accretion of many scattered regulatory and structural changes rather than through introduction of a few key innovations.

TNF-alpha plays a crucial role in this pathogenesis, but it is also involved in the use of lipids and muscle health. Objective of this study was to explore substrate oxidation and impact of TNF blockade on energy metabolism in children with JIA as compared to healthy children.MethodsFifteen non-TNF-blockaded and 15 TNF-blockaded children with JIA and 15 healthy controls were matched by sex, age, and Tanner stage. Participants completed a submaximal incremental exercise test on ergocycle to determine fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates by indirect calorimetry.ResultsThe maximal fat oxidation rate during exercise was lower in JIA children untreated by TNF blockade (134.345.2mg.min(-1)) when compared to the controls (225.392.9mg.min(-1), p=0.007); but was higher in JIA children under TNF blockade (163.2 +/- 59.0mg.min(-1), p=0.31) when compared to JIA children untreated by TNF blockade. At the same relative exercise intensities, there was no difference in carbohydrate oxidation rate between three groups.Conclusions Lipid metabolism during exercise was found to be impaired in children with JIA. However, TNF treatment seems to improve the fat oxidation rate in this population.Trial registration In ClinicalTrials.gov, reference number NCT02977416, registered on 30 November 2016.

J	Kuntz, Adrien								Two-body potential of Vainshtein screened theories								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				100	2					024024	10.1103/PhysRevD.100.024024			JUL 16 2019	2019	Adding a light scalar degree of freedom to general relativity often induces a fifth force whose magnitude is strongly constrained by laboratory experiments and Solar System tests. The Vainshtein screening mechanism ensures that the effects of this supplementary force are suppressed in dense environments. However, the field solution of theories exhibiting Vainshtein screening is only known in spherically symmetric situations. In this article we examine in different configurations the two-body potential energy of pointlike particles in a specific P(X) theory with Vainshtein screening. We use ideas borrowed from the effective one-body approach of Buonanno and Damour in order to restrict the form of the solution. Our results indicate that, even if Vainshtein screening is also fully active in the equal-mass case, the nonlinear dependance of the two-body energy on the mass ratio implies a violation of the equivalence principle. We compute the contribution of this effect to the Moon orbit for generic theories equipped with Vainshtein screening.

It has been shown that such structures can be modeled as discrete systems of nodes linked by extensional, flexural/torsional interactions corresponding to frame lattices and that the corresponding homogenized models can be strain-gradient models, i.e., models whose effective elastic energy involves components of the first and the second gradients of the displacement field. However, in the existing models, there is no coupling between the classical strain and the strain-gradient terms in the expression of the effective energy. In the present article, under some assumptions on the positions of the nodes of the unit cell, we show that classical strain and strain-gradient strain terms can be coupled. In order to illustrate this coupling we compute the homogenized energy of a particular structure that we call asymmetrical pantographic structure.

Currently, 90% of available water resources are already mobilized and climate change exacerbates the country's aridity which makes it difficult to monitor water needs. With a view to contributing to their effective management and setting future directions for controlling and improving inland fish productivity, a comparative limnological study was carried out on 8 artificial reservoirs that were stocked with mullet fry. This study, based on a review of existing data, provides information on the availability and quality of inland water resources in relation to international standards and the biological potential (plankton, fish and other organisms) of these reservoirs. The satisfactory water quality for aquatic life, as well as the significant growth and production of introduced species associated with the rearing of mullet fry, clearly show that, despite several problems, Tunisian reservoirs represent an important potential that still needs to be developed. To this end, we recommend to improve the fishing techniques and the stocking of mullet fry. In addition, the strengthening of fishermen's groups, the encouragement of private initiative and the quality control of water and fish meat are highly requested.

How closely do mercury trends in fish and other aquatic wildlife track those in the atmosphere? - Implications for evaluating the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				674				58	70		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.101			JUL 15 2019	2019	The Minamata Convention to reduce anthropogenic mercury (Hg) emissions entered into force in 2017, and attention is now focused on how to best monitor its effectiveness at reducing Hg exposure to humans. A key question is how closely Hg concentrations in the human food chain, especially in fish and other aquatic wildlife, will track the changes in atmospheric Hg that are expected to occur following anthropogenic emission reductions. We investigated this question by evaluating several regional groups of case studies where Hg concentrations in aquatic biota have been monitored continuously or intermittently for several decades. Our analysis shows that in most cases Hg time trends in biota did not agree with concurrent Hg trends in atmospheric deposition or concentrations, and the divergence between the two trends has become more apparent over the past two decades. An over-arching general explanation for these results is that the impact of changing atmospheric inputs on biotic Hg is masked by two factors: 1) The aquatic environment contains a large inventory of legacy emitted Hg that remains available for bio-uptake leading to a substantial lag in biotic response time to a change in external inputs; and 2) Biotic Hg trends reflect the dominant effects of changes in multi-causal, local and regional processes (e.g., aquatic or terrestrial biogeochemical processes, feeding ecology, climate) that control the speciation, bio-availability, and bio-uptake of both present-day and legacy emitted Hg. Globally, climate change has become the most prevalent contributor to the divergence. A wide range of biotic Hg outcomes can thus be expected as anthropogenic atmospheric Hg emissions decline, depending on how these processes operate on specific regions and specific organisms. Therefore, evaluating the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention will require biomonitoring of multiple species that represent different trophic and ecological niches in multiple regions of the world.

In this paper, we investigate how catchments impact the taxonomic and functional composition of phytoplankton communities in high mountain lakes, and how this impact varies according to the atmospheric nutrient deposition regime. For two years, we sampled the post snow-melt and the late summer phytoplankton, with a set of biotic and abiotic parameters, in six French alpine lakes with differing catchments (size and vegetation cover) and contrasting nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition regimes. Whatever the nutrient deposition regime, we found that the lakes with the smallest rocky catchments showed the lowest functional richness of phytoplankton communities. The lakes with larger vegetated catchments were characterized by the coexistence of phytoplankton taxa with more diverse strategies in the acquisition and utilization of nutrient resources. The nutrient deposition regime appeared to interact with catchment characteristics in determining which functional groups ultimately developed in lakes. Photoautotroph taxa dominated the phytoplankton assemblages under high NP deposition regime while mixotroph taxa were even more favored in lakes with large vegetated catchments under low NP deposition regime. Phytoplankton functional changes were likely related to the leaching of terrestrial organic matter from catchments evidenced by analyses of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios in seston and zooplankton. Plankton delta N-15 values indicated greater water-soil interaction in lakes with larger vegetated catchments, while delta C-13 values indicated the effective mineralization of the organic matter in lakes. The role played by catchments should be considered when seeking to determine the vulnerability of high altitude lakes to future changes, as catchments' own properties will vary under changes related to climate and airborne contaminants.

The tip first cuts and then pushes and folds graphene during zigzag movements. The pushed graphene has been analyzed using various Raman microscopy plots-A(D)/A(G) X E-L(4) vs Gamma(G), omega(2D) VS Gamma(2D), Gamma(2D) vs Gamma(G), omega(2D+/-) vs Gamma(2D+/-), and A(2D-)/A(2D+) vs A(2D)/A(G). We show that the SLG in-plane properties are maintained under the folding process and that a few tens of graphene layers are stacked, with a limited number of structural defects. A blue shift of about 20 cm(-1) of the 2D band is observed. The relative intensity of the 2D_ and 2D+ bands have been related to structural defects, giving evidence of their role in the inner and outer processes at play close to the Dirac cone.

After indenting a 850 nm deep pattern on the SrTiO3 surface with a 8 GPa hardness and an 83 GPa indentation modulus by a Berkovich tip, the resulting deformation patterns are imaged by Raman spectroscopy and by second harmonic generation microscopy. Cross-shaped compressively stressed regions along the cubic SrTiO3 primary slip planes are observed. These zones relax toward the unstrained bulk material through localized strain gradients on a length scale of several microns. Second harmonic tomography reveals the reduction of the crystal's centrosymmetry in the vicinity of the crosslike features due to a strain gradient. These results indicate the appearance of flexoelectricity following the nanoindentation process due to the creation of an inhomogeneous strain.

In this context, reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) have emerged to fulfil these requirements. RMS is one of the latest manufacturing paradigms, where machines components, software or material handling units can be added, removed, modified or interchanged as needed and when imposed by the necessity to react and respond rapidly and cost-effectively to changing. This research work addresses the multi-objective single-product multi-unit process plan generation problem in a reconfigurable manufacturing environment where three hybrid heuristics are proposed and compared namely: repetitive single-unit process plan heuristic (RSUPP), iterated local search on single-unit process plans heuristic (LSSUPP) and archive-based iterated local search heuristic (ABILS). Single-unit process plans are generated using the adapted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Moreover, in addition to the minimisation of the classical total production cost and the total completion time, the minimisation of the maximum machines exploitation time is considered as a novel optimisation criterion, in order to have high quality products. To illustrate the applicability of the three approaches, examples are presented and the obtained numerical results are analysed.

Preference for initiating steps with the less-involved (preferred) leg after a perturbation has been reported with limited information on the stepping response of the more-involved (non-preferred) leg. Understanding the capacity of both legs to respond to a perturbation would enhance the design of future treatment approaches. This pilot study investigated the difference in perturbation-induced stepping between legs in stroke participant and non-impaired controls. We hypothesized that stepping performance will be different between groups as well as between legs for post-stroke participants. Methods: Thirty-six participants (20 persons post-stroke, 16 age matched controls) were given an anterior perturbation from three stance positions: symmetrical (SS), preferred asymmetrical (PAS-70% body weight on the preferred leg), and non-preferred asymmetrical (N-PAS-70% body weight on the non-preferred leg). Kinematic and kinetic data were collected to measure anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), characteristics of the first step (onset, length, height, duration), number of steps, and velocity of the body at heel strike. Group differences were tested using the Mann-Whitney U-test and differences between legs tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with an alpha level of 0.05. Results: Stepping with the more-involved leg increased from 11.5% of trials in SS and N-PAS up to 46% in PAS stance position for participants post-stroke. Post-stroke participants had an earlier APA and always took more steps than controls to regain balance. However, differences between post-stroke and control participants were mainly found when stance position was modified. Compare to controls, steps with the preferred leg (N-PAS) were earlier and shorter (in time and length), whereas steps with the non-preferred leg (PAS) were also shorter but took longer. For post-stroke participants, step duration was longer and utilized more steps when stepping with the more-involved leg compared to the less-involved leg. Conclusions: Stepping with the more-involved leg can be facilitated by unweighting the leg. The differences between groups, and legs in post-stroke participants illustrate the simultaneous bipedal role (support and stepping) both legs have in reactive stepping and should be considered for reactive balance training.

Thanks to the UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, it appeared that ANQ-MMA formed 1:1 and 1:2 complexes with lead (II) and ANQ-ST only 1:1 complex. For both molecules, the fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEM) signal intensity increased from 0 to 100 mu mol.L-1 of lead (II) followed by a saturation for higher concentrations. The decomposition of the obtained EEMs gave a set of empiric fluorescent components that have been directly linked to the distribution of lead complexes obtained with the UV-visible absorption spectroscopy study. This correlation allowed to evidence metal/ligand complex stoichiometry and emerge as a new method to identify empiric components. Moreover, the two ligands showed a promising selectivity for Pb2+, turning them interesting probes for this hazardous metal.

In the present study, all these aspects are investigated using in-situ (Lagrangian drifter trajectories and Argo float profiles) and satellite data (Absolute Dynamic Topography, Sea Level Anomaly, Sea Surface Temperature, wind products) over the period from 1993 to 2018. The availability of long time series of data and high-resolution multi-sensor surface currents allow us to add new details on the circulation features and on their driving mechanisms and to detect new permanent eddies not yet described in literature. The structures prevailing in winter are mainly driven by wind, whereas those prevailing in summer are regulated by topographical forcing on surface currents. The strength of the surface structures located at the western entrance of the Ionian Sea and of the mesoscale activity along the northern Sicily coast is modulated by the large-scale internal variability. The vertical hydrological characteristics of these mesoscale eddies are delineated using the Argo float profiles inside these structures.

In this work, telomer of dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate (DFMA), triclosan acrylate (TA), and 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (KH590) is grafted to bis-silanol terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), yielding a novel self-stratifying silicone coating containing nonleaching antifoulants. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals that the antifoulant groups are enriched on the coating surface due to DFMA migration. Such a modified PDMS coating can significantly inhibit the growth of marine bacterial biofilm and the adhesion of diatoms owing to the nonleaching antifoulant groups. On the other hand, the coating exhibits a good fouling release performance since it inherits the low surface energy (approximate to 20 mJ m(-2)) and low elastic modulus (<2 MPa) from PDMS forming a physically dynamic surface. Marine field tests demonstrate that the coating has excellent antifouling ability after immersion in natural seawater for more than 6 months.

J	Chalopin, Jeremie; Chepoi, Victor								1-Safe Petri Nets and Special Cube Complexes: Equivalence and Applications								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC				20	3					17	10.1145/3322095			JUL 2019	2019	Nielsen et al. [35] proved that every 1-safe Petri net N unfolds into an event structure E-N. By a result of Thiagarajan [46], these unfoldings are exactly the trace-regular event structures. Thiagarajan [46] conjectured that regular event structures correspond exactly to trace-regular event structures. In a recent paper (Chalopin and Chepoi [12]), we disproved this conjecture, based on the striking bijection between domains of event structures, median graphs, and CAT(0) cube complexes. However, we proved that Thiagarajan's conjecture is true for regular event structures whose domains are principal filters of universal covers of finite special cube complexes. In the current article, we prove the converse: To any finite 1-safe Petri net N, one can associate a finite special cube complex X-N such that the domain of the event structure E-N (obtained as the unfolding of N) is a principal filter of the universal cover (X) over tildeN of X-N. This establishes a bijection between 1-safe Petri nets and finite special cube complexes and provides a combinatorial characterization of trace-regular event structures. Using this bijection and techniques from graph theory and geometry (MSO theory of graphs, bounded treewidth, and bounded hyperbolicity), we disprove yet another conjecture by Thiagarajan (from the paper with Yang [48]) that the monadic second-order logic of a 1-safe Petri net (i.e., of its event structure unfolding) is decidable if and only if its unfolding is grid-free. It was proven by Thiagarajan and Yang [48] that the MSO logic is undecidable if the unfolding is not grid-free. Our counterexample is the trace-regular event structure that arises from a virtually special square complex Z. The domain of this event structure (E)over dot(Z) is the principal filter of the universal cover (Z) over tilde of Z in which to each vertex we added a pendant edge. The graph of the domain of (E)over dot(Z) has bounded hyperbolicity (and, thus, the event structure (E)over dot(Z) is grid-free) but has infinite treewidth. Using results of Seese, Courcelle, and Muller and Schupp, we show that this implies that the MSO theory of the event structure (E)over dot(Z) is undecidable.

At the first stage of these efforts, as it often happens, the research was based on the results of mathematical investigations. The problem to be solved was stated as follows: determine the material (micro)structure governed by those equations that specify a desired behavior. Addressing this problem has led to the synthesis of second gradient materials. In the second stage, it has been necessary to develop numerical integration schemes and the corresponding codes for solving, in physically relevant cases, the chosen equations. Finally, it has been necessary to physically construct the theoretically synthesized microstructures. This has been possible by means of the recent developments in rapid prototyping technologies, which allow for the fabrication of some complex (micro)structures considered, up to now, to be simply some mathematical dreams. We show here a panorama of the results of our efforts (1) in designing pantographic metamaterials, (2) in exploiting the modern technology of rapid prototyping, and (3) in the mechanical testing of many real prototypes. Among the key findings that have been obtained, there are the following ones: pantographic metamaterials (1) undergo very large deformations while remaining in the elastic regime, (2) are very tough in resisting to damage phenomena, (3) exhibit robust macroscopic mechanical behavior with respect to minor changes in their microstructure and micromechanical properties, (4) have superior strength to weight ratio, (5) have predictable damage behavior, and (6) possess physical properties that are critically dictated by their geometry at the microlevel.

Si Doping of Vapor-Liquid-Solid GaAs Nanowires: n-Type or p-Type?								NANO LETTERS				19	7			4498	4504		10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01308			JUL 2019	2019	The incorporation of Si into vapor-liquid-solid GaAs nanowires often leads to p-type doping, whereas it is routinely used as an n-dopant of planar layers. This property limits the applications of GaAs nanowires in electronic and optoelectronic devices. The strong amphoteric behavior of Si in nanowires is not yet fully understood. Here, we present the first attempt to quantify this behavior as a function of the droplet composition and temperature. It is shown that the doping type critically depends on the As/Ga ratio in the droplet. In sharp contrast to vapor-solid growth, the droplet contains very few As atoms, which enhance their reverse transfer from solid to liquid. As a result, Si atoms preferentially replace As in GaAs, leading to p-type doping in nanowires. Hydride vapor phase epitaxy provides the highest As concentrations in the catalyst droplets during their vapor-liquid-solid growth, resulting in n-type dopant behavior of Si. We present experimental data on n-doped Si-doped GaAs nanowires grown by this method and explain the doping within our model. These results give a clear route for obtaining n-type or p-type Si doping in GaAs nanowires and may be extended to other III-V nanowires.

Understanding and predicting marine fish production for spatially and demographically complex populations in changing environmental conditions is however still a difficult task. Indeed, fisheries assessment is mostly based on deterministic models that lack realistic parameterizations of the intricate biological and physical processes shaping recruitment, a cornerstone in population dynamics. We use here a large metapopulation of a harvested fish, the European hake (Merluccius merluccius), managed across transnational boundaries in the northwestern Mediterranean, to model fish recruitment dynamics in terms of physics-dependent drivers related to dispersal and survival. The connectivity among nearby subpopulations is evaluated by simulating multi-annual Lagrangian indices of larval retention, imports, and self-recruitment. Along with a proxy of the regional hydroclimate influencing early life stages survival, we then statistically determine the relative contribution of dispersal and hydroclimate for recruitment across contiguous management units. We show that inter-annual variability of recruitment is well reproduced by hydroclimatic influences and synthetic connectivity estimates. Self-recruitment (i.e., the ratio of retained locally produced larvae to the total number of incoming larvae) is the most powerful metric as it integrates the roles of retained local recruits and immigrants from surrounding subpopulations and is able to capture circulation patterns affecting recruitment at the scale of management units. We also reveal that the climatic impact on recruitment is spatially structured at regional scale due to contrasting biophysical processes not related to dispersal. Self-recruitment calculated for each management unit explains between 19% and 32.9% of the variance of recruitment variability, that is much larger than the one explained by spawning stock biomass alone, supporting an increase of consideration of connectivity processes into stocks assessment. By acknowledging the structural and ecological complexity of marine populations, this study provides the scientific basis to link spatial management and temporal assessment within large marine metapopulations. Our results suggest that fisheries management could be improved by combining information of physical oceanography (from observing systems and operational models), opening new opportunities such as the development of short-term projections and dynamic spatial management.

Adding chlorine to bromide-rich waters leads to the rapid oxidation of bromide ions and leads to the formation of brominated disinfection by-products (bromo-DBPs) that exert adverse effects on various biological models. Bromo-DBPs are regularly encountered within industrialized embayments, potentially impacting marine organisms. Of these, bromoform, tribromoacetic acid and tribromophenol are among the most prevalent. In the present study, we tested the potential toxicity and genotoxicity of these disinfection by-products, using sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus, embryos. We highlighted that tribromophenol showed higher toxicity compared to bromoform and tribromoacetic acid. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was detected when tested in combination. Pluteus cells exposed for 1h to mixtures of DBPs at several concentrations demonstrated significant DNA damage. Finally, when compared to a non-exposed population, sea urchins living in a bromo-DPB-polluted area produced more resistant progenies, as if they were locally adapted. This hypothesis remains to be tested in order to better understand the obvious impact of complex bromo-DBPs environments on marine wildlife.

Specifically, the goal is to characterize a detected fault by estimating its occurrence date. For that purpose, partially observed stochastic Petri nets are used to model the system, the failure processes, and the sensors. From the proposed modeling and collected dated measurements. the probabilities of consistent trajectories are computed and diagnosis in terms of faults probability is established as a consequence. For each detected fault, the probability density function of its occurrence date is approximated. This estimation improves the diagnosis by providing the most probable time interval of the fault occurrence. The interest of fault datation and the applicability of the proposed approach are showed through a case study that represents a distribution system.

We show that if the Lasota-Yorke-type inequality for the transfer operator of a first return map is satisfied in a Banach space B, and the absolutely continuous invariant measure obtained is weak mixing, in terms of a periodicity, then, under some renewal condition, the maps have polynomial decay of correlations for observables in B : We also provide some general conditions that give a periodicity for expanding maps in higher dimensional spaces. As applications, we obtain lower bounds for piecewise expanding maps with an indifferent fixed point and for which we also allow non-Markov structure and unbounded distortion. The observables are functions that have bounded variation or satisfy quasi-H Holder conditions and have their support bounded away from the neutral fixed points.

In this work, we devise an efficient algorithm to compute these constants to arbitrary precision with rigorous error bounds, for the first time achieving this with low complexity with respect to the order n. Our computations are based on an integral representation with a hyperbolic kernel that decays exponentially fast. The algorithm consists of locating an approximate steepest descent contour and then evaluating the integral numerically in ball arithmetic using the Petras algorithm with a Taylor expansion for bounds near the saddle point. An implementation is provided in the Arb library. We can, for example, compute gamma(n) (1) to 1000 digits in a minute for any n up to n = 10(100). We also provide other interesting integral representations for gamma(n)(v), zeta(s), zeta(s, v), some polygamma functions, and the Lerch transcendent.

We then derive the form of the effective action to all orders.

Si1-xGex nanoantennas with a tailored Raman response and light-to-heat conversion for advanced sensing applications								NANOSCALE				11	24			11634	11641		10.1039/c9nr01837a			JUN 28 2019	2019	Active light-emitting all-dielectric nanoantennas recently have demonstrated great potential as highly efficient nanoscale light sources owing to their strong luminescent and Raman responses. However, their large-scale fabrication faces a number of problems related to productivity limits of existing lithography techniques. Thus, high-throughput fabrication strategies allowing in a facile way to tailor of the nanoantenna emission and thermal properties in the process of their fabrication are highly desirable for various applications. Here, we propose a cost-effective approach to large-scale fabrication of Si1-xGex alloyed Mie nanoresonators possessing an enhanced inherent Raman response which can be simply tailored via tuning the Ge concentration. Moreover, by tailoring the relative Ge composition one can gradually change a complex refractive index of the produced Si1-xGex alloy, which affects the ratio between radiative and nonradiative losses in Si1-xGex nanoantennas, which is crucial for optimization of their optical heating efficiency. Composition-tunable Si1-xGex nanoantennas with an optimized size, light-to-heat conversion and Raman response are implemented for non-invasive sensing of 4-aminothiophenol molecules with a temperature feedback modality and high subwavelength spatial resolution. The results are important for advanced multichannel optical sensing, providing information on analyte's composition, analyte-nanoantenna temperature response and spatial position.

To respond to this objective, the links between two kind of motivators (i.e., promotion and prevention foci), the Selection, Optimization and Compensation (SOC) self-management strategy, and adherence to exercise and diet of patients with type 2 diabetes were investigated for the first time in the literature. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 491 French volunteer participants with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for at least 3 months (Age = 61.66 +/- 9.63; BMI = 29.8 +/- 5.9). Participants completed an online self-report survey measuring SOC strategy, promotion and prevention foci, and adherence to exercise and diet. Results: The main results of path and bootstrapping analysis demonstrated that promotion focus was positively related with SOC strategy (beta = .69, p < .001) whereas prevention focus was not (beta = -.01, ns.). On the other hand, SOC strategy was positively related with exercise (beta = .20, p < .05), general diet (beta = .49, p < .001), fruit and vegetable consumption (beta = .27, p < .001), and spacing of carbohydrates (beta = .40, p < .001), and mediated the positive link between promotion focus and these behaviors (bootstrapped 95% CI: [.11; .40], [.52; .81], [.22; .54], [.37; .70], respectively). Conclusion: This paper addresses a gap in previous research by evidencing a motivator that promotes self-management for exercise and diet among patients with type 2 diabetes. Our results suggest that physicians should privilege an interaction with patients oriented toward promotional motivation so as to favor their patients' self-management regarding exercise and diet.

We discuss both the conservative dynamics, e.g., how the energy of the bound system is corrected by the conformal and disformal interactions, and the dissipative part where scalars and gravitons are emitted. The first disformal correction to the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann Lagrangian is obtained using both the Fokker method relying on the equations of motion and an Effective Field Theory approach using Feynman diagrams. This leads to a correction to the energy functional at the 2 post-Newotnian level for eccentric orbits, which vanishes for circular orbits up to the 7 post-Newtonian order. The dissipative power from the disformal interaction gives a correction to the monopole and quadrupole terms in the presence of a conformal coupling. Although this correction vanishes for circular orbits at leading order, this is not the case for elliptical orbits allowing us to derive a bound on the disformal coupling from the time drift of the period for the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, which is slightly stronger than the one from fifth force tests. We conclude that the prospect of observing disformal effects for inspiraling systems lies in the accurate monitoring of eccentric trajectories as expected for the LISA experiment.

Synchrotron radiation-based CXD using a nanoscale x-ray beam is shown to be a powerful tool to explore the crystallographic properties of InP nanocrystals (NCs) selectively grown on Si nanotip wafers. CXD characterization clearly clarifies, with atomic sensitivity and without complex sample preparation, the crystallographic properties of the selected InP NC such as the structure of the facets, the strain, the existence of defects (stacking faults and microtwins), and the size of the defected crystallites. Several selected InP NCs explored by CXD reveal homogeneous structures. The CXD results are in good agreement with electron microscopy. These results not only confirm that nanoheteroepitaxy is a promising approach to monolithically integrate high-quality III-V compounds on silicon wafers, but also opens a pathway to nondestructively explore the crystallinity of materials on the nanometer scale, particularly in nano-electronic and nano-optoelectronic devices.

In the context of applications to cosmology, such "energy diffusion" from the low energy matter degrees of freedom to the discrete structures underlying spacetime would lead to the emergence of an effective dark energy term in Einstein's equations. We estimate this effect using a (relational) hypothesis about the materialization of discreteness in quantum gravity which is motivated by the strict observational constraints supporting the validity of Lorentz invariance at low energies. Arguments based on a simple dimensional analysis lead to an estimate of an effective cosmological constant agreeing in order of magnitude with its observed value. If correct, this would constitute remarkable empirical evidence for a Planckian granular aspect of spacetime.

Conversely, pairwise interactions are often not enough to characterize social contagion processes such as opinion formation or the adoption of novelties, where complex mechanisms of influence and reinforcement are at work. Here we introduce a higher-order model of social contagion in which a social system is represented by a simplicial complex and contagion can occur through interactions in groups of different sizes. Numerical simulations of the model on both empirical and synthetic simplicial complexes highlight the emergence of novel phenomena such as a discontinuous transition induced by higher-order interactions. We show analytically that the transition is discontinuous and that a bistable region appears where healthy and endemic states co-exist. Our results help explain why critical masses are required to initiate social changes and contribute to the understanding of higher-order interactions in complex systems.

FCC Collaboration						FCC Physics Opportunities: Future Circular Collider Conceptual Design Report Volume 1								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C				79	6					474	10.1140/epjc/s10052-019-6904-3			JUN 5 2019	2019	We review the physics opportunities of the Future Circular Collider, covering its e(+)e(-), pp, ep and heavy ion programmes. We describe the measurement capabilities of each FCC component, addressing the study of electroweak, Higgs and strong interactions, the top quark and flavour, as well as phenomena beyond the Standard Model. We highlight the synergy and complementarity of the different colliders, which will contribute to a uniquely coherent and ambitious research programme, providing an unmatchable combination of precision and sensitivity to new physics.

To date, the quantification of trophic and morphological variation among populations of coral reef fish at multiple geographical scales remains limited. This study aimed to quantify diet and body shape variation among four populations of the damselfish Dascyllus abudafur living in different environmental conditions from the central Red Sea and from Madagascar. Stomach content analyses showed that one adaptive response of D. abudafur inhabiting turbid waters is a trophic shift from almost exclusive zooplanktivory to a diet consisting of planktonic and benthic prey. Our morphometric data reveal differences in cephalic profile and body shape among populations, in agreement with this variation in trophic strategy. Isotopic diversity and body shape disparity vary among populations and we thus demonstrate that coral reef fish populations are not equal in terms of phenotypic diversity among sites and regions. Finally, our comparative analysis reveals that the main axes of body shape variation among populations are shared at both small (Red Sea sites) and large (Madagascar and Red Sea sites) spatial scales. This study raises new questions about the factors governing the direction of response to selection in this fish species.

The observations were carried out with moderate winds (2-10 m/s) and averaged wave heights of 1.5 m. Most of the time, there was a swell, with an averaged wave age (the ratio between wave phase speed and wind speed) being equal to 2.8 1.6. Three flux calculation methods are used, namely, the eddy covariance (EC), the inertial dissipation (ID), and the bulk methods. For the EC method, a spectral technique is proposed to correct wind data from platform motion. A mean bias affecting the friction velocity (u(*)) is then evaluated. The comparison between EC u(*) and ID u(*) estimates suggests that a constant imbalance term ((imb)) equal to 0.4 is required in the ID method, possibly due to wave influence on our data. Overall, the confidence in the calculated u(*) estimates is found to be on the order of 10%. The values of the drag coefficient (C-D) are in good agreement with the parameterizations of Smith (1988, ) in medium-range winds and of Edson et al. (2013, ) in light winds. According to our data, the inverse wave age varies linearly with wind speed, as in Edson et al. (2013, ), but our estimates of the Charnock coefficient do not increase with wind speed, which is possibly related to sampling swell-dominated seas. We find that the Stanton number is independent from wind speed. Plain Language Summary A small wave-following platform was deployed in 2011-2017 across four oceanic regions. The data are used to estimate turbulent fluxes, which are physical quantities that describe the exchanges of heat and momentum through the air-sea interface. In weather models, simplified representations of the fluxes are used, which themselves depend on coefficients named drag coefficient for momentum exchange and Stanton number for temperature exchange, respectively. In this study, we evaluate these coefficients. First, we compare the flux estimates from the three main available methods. We adjust the parameters in the methods to reach the best possible agreement between the calculated fluxes. Two types of corrections are proposed, depending on the method considered, because turbulence data are modified by the motion of the platform and by the proximity of waves. Data are corrected by applying a mean bias to the fluxes and by accounting for a nonmeasured term in the turbulence equations. Then, we analyze the wind dependence of the estimated drag coefficient and Stanton number. We find that drag is slowly increasing with wind speed, in agreement with existing models. Estimates of the Stanton number have biases but which do not depend on wind speed.

Vertical Motions and Their Effects on a Biogeochemical Tracer in a Cyclonic Structure Finely Observed in the Ligurian Sea								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS				124	6			3561	3574		10.1029/2018JC014392			JUN 2019	2019	Vertical velocities can be estimated indirectly from in situ observations by theoretical frameworks like the omega-equation. Direct measures of vertical exchanges are challenging due to their typically ephemeral spatiotemporal scales. In this study we address this problem with an adaptive sampling strategy coupling various biophysical instruments. We analyze the 3-D organization of a cyclonic mesoscale structure finely sampled during the Observing Submesoscale Coupling At High Resolution cruise in the Ligurian Sea during fall 2015. The observations, acquired with a moving vessel profiler, highlight a subsurface low-salinity layer (similar or equal to 50m), as well as rising isopycnals, generated by geostrophic cyclonic circulation, in the structure's center. Reconstructed 3-D fields of density and horizontal velocities are used to estimate the vertical velocity field down to 250m by applying the adiabatic QG omega-equation, for the first time in this region. The vertical motions are characterized by multipolar patterns of downward and upward velocities on the edges of the structure and significantly smaller vertical velocities in its center. Both the 3-D distribution of particles (size >= 100 mu m), measured with a laser optical plankton counter, and the Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus abundances (cell per cubic meter) measured by flow cytometry are consistent with the 3-D velocity field. In particular, a secondary vertical recirculation is identified that upwells particles (from 250 to 100m) along isohalines to the structure's center. Besides demonstrating the effect of vertical patterns on biogeochemical distributions, this case study suggests to use particle matter as a tracer to assess physical dynamics.

This model is applied to the optimization of a kicking system used on limited size robots for propelling real soccer balls at the RoboCup.

The H-MIPs were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. High-performance liquid chromatography combined with UV-Visible spectroscopy were used to assess the efficiency of the extraction procedure and, furthermore, to investigate the recognition properties of the H-MIPs. Obtaining an imprinting factor of 3.38 for hypericin strongly indicated a successful formation of molecularly imprinted cavities onto the H-MIPs. A fair selectivity towards hypericin was tested in comparison to the interfering molecule pseudohypericin.

We compare poverty measures such as the Alkire and Foster index with alternative poverty indices that are sensitive to inequality. Poverty is estimated using Demographic and Health Surveys for different years for Malawi (2004, 2010 and 2015), for Mozambique (2003 and 2011), Tanzania (2004, 2010 and 2015) and for Zimbabwe (2005, 2010 and 2015). Our findings show that one obtains insightful information when looking at the breadth and inequality components of multidimensional poverty.

Preparation, characterization and photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B dye over a novel Zn-3(PO4)(2)/BiPO4 catalyst								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				7	3					103075	10.1016/j.jece.2019.103075			JUN 2019	2019	In this work, a facile method was used to synthesize the Zn-3(PO4)(2)/BiPO4 composite photocatalysts with different Bi contents followed by heat treatment at 900 degrees C for 3 h. The as-prepared samples were studied by a variety of characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The UV-vis spectroscopy was used to analyze the evolution of Rhodamine B discoloration in presence of the synthesized phosphate photocatalysts. The XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, DRS and XPS analyses confirmed the formation of heterojunction structure between both materials, during the process of co-precipitation and ulterior heat treatment. The photocatalytic tests showed that photocatalytic ability of the 70% Bi-Zn-3(PO4)(2) composites was higher than that of pure Zn-3(PO4)(2) and BiPO4 after 1 h of UV-illumination. The obviously enhanced photocatalytic activity of the 70% Bi-Zn-3(PO4)(2) sample could be mainly attributed to the formation of the heterojunction, accelerating the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. A plausible mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of RhB on Zn-3(PO4)(2)/BiPO4 composites is proposed. The reduction in the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) revealed the mineralization of dye along with color removal. Thus, it can be suggested that the 70% Bi-Zn-3(PO4)(2) can serve as a promising photocatalyst in the degradation of organic contaminants under UV light.

Considering as case study Horndeski theories with the speed of gravitational waves equal to that of light, we show how constraints on the free parameters and the large-scale structure phenomenological functions can be improved by two ingredients: firstly by complementing the set of redshift-space distortions data with the three recent measurements of the growth rate f and the amplitude of matter fluctuations sigma(8) from the VIPERS and SDSS collaborations; secondly by applying a local Solar System bound on the variation of the Newton constant. This analysis allows us to conclude that: i) despite firmly restricting the predictions of weaker gravity, the inclusion of the Solar System bound does not prevent suppressed growth relative to the standard model Lambda CDM at low redshifts; ii) the same bound in conjunction with the growth of structure data strongly restricts the redshift evolution of the gravitational slip parameter to be close to unity and the present value is constrained to one at the 10 level; iii) the growth of structure data favours a fifth force contribution to the effective gravitational coupling at low redshifts and at more than two sigma at present time.

Here, the collection of such data is challenging, especially at sea, where long-term monitoring is usually logistically feasible only in the proximity of permanent research stations. In recent years, underwater photogrammetry has emerged as a non-destructive and low-cost method for high-resolution topographic reconstruction. We decided to apply this technique to videos, recorded during standard SCUBA surveys of Antarctic benthos in Tethys Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) in 2006 and 2015 and originally not meant for photogrammetry. Our aim was to assess the validity and utility of the photogrammetric method to describe benthic communities from the perspective of long-term monitoring. For this purpose, two of the transects surveyed in 2015 were revisited in 2017. Videos were processed with photogrammetric procedures to obtain 3D models of the seafloor and inhabiting organisms. Overall, a total of six 20m-long transects, corresponding to a total area of200m(2) of seafloor were analysed. Accuracy of the resulting models, expressed in terms of Length Measurement Error (LME), was 1.9mm on average. The 2017 transects showed marked differences in some species, such as a 25-49% increase in the number of sea urchins Sterechinus neumayeri (Meissner, 1900) and the complete disappearance of some sponges Mycale (Oxymycale) acerata Kirkpatrick, 1907. Our analyses confirm the efficacy of photogrammetry for monitoring programmes, including their value for the re-analysis of legacy video footage.

Random angle grain boundary formation and evolution dynamics during Si directional solidification								ACTA MATERIALIA				171				253	260		10.1016/j.actamat.2019.04.010			JUN 1 2019	2019	The growth of multicrystalline silicon and the formation of a random angle grain boundary, as well as the dislocation generation and expansion is observed dynamically in situ, by Synchrotron X-ray imaging techniques. The focus is kept on a random angle grain boundary since its behavior is particularly important to better understand the HP me-Si (High Performance Multi-crystalline Silicon) photovoltaic properties. Due to the process conditions and to the grain competition that occurs during the solidification, a facetted {111}fillfacetted {111} groove is formed by this random angle grain boundary at the solid/ liquid interface. It is shown how the shape of the solid/liquid interface allows the change of the preferential {111} growth facet and affects the grain boundary propagation direction. In one of the groove configurations, the two adjacent (111) facets do not have the same growth velocity and as a consequence the corresponding grain boundary does not follow the bisector of the angle between the two facets. Indeed, the direction of the grain boundary is determined by the growth velocities of the facets which control the grain competition. Moreover, under these experimental conditions a clear relationship is observed between the existence of random angle grain boundaries and the local generation of dislocations as well as their expansion. By comparison, dislocation emission is not observed at the level of Sigma 3 {111} grain boundaries. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.		[Tsoutsouva, M.

Accordingly, this study examines the impact of tourism development on economic growth, CO2 emissions and environmental quality in Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco (Muslim majority countries). An autoregressive distributed lag model is used to analyze data for the period 1980-2014. The study further examines the long and short-term relationship between tourism and economic growth; and tourism and environmental quality. The study reveals that economic growth converges to its long-run equilibrium at an adjusting speed of about 25.7% in Morocco, 5.8% in Egypt, and 2.1% in Tunisia. The findings of the study confirm that tourism growth is linked to environmental quality. The study reveals that tourism has a negative effect on the environment quality in Egypt whereas a positive effect in Tunisia and neutral in Morocco. Using the EKC hypothesis tests, the study concludes the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and the level of income for Morocco and Egypt, whereas for Tunisia, this relationship is U-shaped. The study also offers policy implications.

The results showed that the hydroxyl end group in PDMS-OH takes part to the PDMS chain degradation in nitrogen atmosphere, the higher hydroxyl group concentration in the samples the lower thermal degradation temperatures. The degradation of the PDMS block (5000 g mol(-1) and 10,000 g mol(-1)) in PDMS-block-PMASi, PDMS-block-poly(MASi-stat-BMA) and poly(MAS1-stat-BMA)-block-PDMS-block-poly(MASi-stat-BMA) copolymers with similar molar mass values and similar PDMS block molar mass started at lower temperatures when the amount of MASi in the second block increased. The thermal degradation temperature of the methacrylic block whose number-average molar mass is in the range of 10,000 g mol(-1) to 50,000 g mol(-1) was inversely proportional to its length. Moreover, TGA results were useful to demonstrate that the thermal degradation of triblock copolymers starts at a lower temperature in comparison with diblock copolymers prepared from trithiocarbonate-based PDMS RAFT agents of similar molar masses.

The result holds true as well for the p-compliance in the scalar case of conductivity. Then we study the limit problem as p+, which corresponds to differentiate the Wasserstein distance in optimal mass transportation with respect to horizontal perturbations of the two marginals. Also in this case, we obtain an existence result for the derivative, and we show that it is found by solving a minimization problem over the family of all optimal transport plans. When the latter contains only one element, we prove that the derivative of the p-compliance converges to the derivative of the Wasserstein distance in the limit as p+infinity.

This VCO has an inductor-capacitor (LC) topology though using an active inductor based on a gyrator-C structure. It uses n-bits controlled CMOS inverters for coarse frequency tuning and diode varactor for fine frequency tuning. Implemented in 130-nm CMOS technology, the VCO can cover a frequency tuning of 1.22-2.6GHz. It achieves a phase noise of -87dBc/Hz at 1MHz with a power consumption of 4mW from 1.1-V supply. The active die area is only 54x59m(2).

To this end, an experimental protocol describes the induction of P300, SSVEP and mental workload (which leads to mental fatigue by varying time-on-task) in different scenarios where environmental artifacts are controlled (obstacles number, obstacles velocities, ambient luminosity). Ten subjects took part in the experiment (with two suffering from cerebral palsy). Their mission is to navigate along a corridor from a starting point A to a goal point B where specific flickering stimuli are introduced to perform the P300 task. On the other hand, SSVEP task is elicited thanks to 10 Hz flickering lights. Correlated features are considered as inputs to fusion block which estimates mental workload. In order to deal with uncertainties and heterogeneity of P300 and SSVEP features, Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidential reasoning is introduced. As the goal is to assess the reliability for the estimation of mental fatigue levels, D-S is compared to multi layer perception and linear discriminant analysis. The results show that D-S globally outperforms the other classifiers (although its performance significantly decreases between healthy and palsied groups). Finally we discuss the feasibility of such a fusion proposal in real life situation.

I. Parameterization, calibration and evaluation								ECOLOGICAL MODELLING				401				1	19		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.03.005			JUN 1 2019	2019	An end-to-end model named OSMOSE-GoL has been built for the Gulf of Lions, the main French Mediterranean fishing area. This spatialized dynamic model links the coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model Eco3-MS/SYMPHONIE (LTL - low trophic level model) to OSMOSE (HTL - high trophic level model). It includes 15 compartments of living organisms, five from the LTL model (ie. nanophytoplankton, microphytoplankton, nanozooplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and ten from the HTL model (northern krill, southern shortfin squid, European pilchard, European anchovy, European sprat, Atlantic horse mackerel, Atlantic mackerel, blue whiting, European hake and Atlantic bluefin tuna). With the exception of northern krill and European sprat, all HTL species are commercially exploited and undergo fisheries mortality pressure. The modeled species represent more than 70% of annual catches in this area. This paper presents the parameterization, calibration and evaluation of this model with satellite data for phytoplankton and with biomass, landings, diet and trophic level data for HTL groups. For most species, the diets in output of OSMOSE-GoL are similar to field and literature data in terms of dominant prey groups and species. However, some differences were observed. Various reasons may explain the mismatch between the modeled diet and field data. Benthic prey sometimes observed in the stomach content of the HTL predators were not modeled in OSMOSE-GoL. Field studies were carried out at specific periods and locations, while our data concern the period 2001-2004 and the entire modeled domain. Inter- and intra-annual variations in spatial distribution and density of prey may also explain these differences. The model estimates trophic level values similar to those cited in the literature for all the HTL compartments. These values are also close to the trophic levels estimated by a previous Ecopath model for the same area and period. Even though some improvements are still possible, this model may already be of use to explore fishery or Marine Protected Areas scenarios for socio-ecosystem management issues.

It is known that, for shallow P systems, that is, with only one level of nesting, non-confluence allows them to solve conjecturally harder problems than confluent P systems, thus reaching PSPACE. Here we show that PSPACE is not only a bound, but actually an exact characterization. Therefore, the power endowed by non-confluence to shallow P systems is equal to the power gained by confluent P systems when non-elementary membrane division and polynomial depth are allowed, thus suggesting a connection between the roles of non-confluence and nesting depth.

Eighteen healthy men performed isometric quadriceps contractions at 15% of maximal voluntary contraction (blocks of 170 s interspaced by neuromuscular evaluations) until exhaustion. This task was performed on three separate days: (a) in the absence of concomitant cognitive task, (b) with concomitant 1-back task, and (c) with concomitant 2-back task. Autonomic nervous system activity, perceived exertion, and cognitive performance were continuously monitored. Peripheral and central determinants of neuromuscular function were assessed at rest, between each block, and at task failure using femoral nerve stimulation. Endurance time was shorter during 2-back (982 +/- 545 s) and 1-back (1,128 +/- 592 s) conditions, compared with control (1,306 +/- 836 s). Voluntary activation level was lower in 2-back (87.1%; p < 0.001) and 1-back (88.6%; p = 0.04) conditions compared to control (91.2%) at isotime (100% of the shortest test duration). Sympathetic activity showed a greater increase in 2-back condition compared to control. Perceived muscular exertion was higher during 2-back than during control. Cognitive performance decreased similarly with time during both cognitive-motor dual task but was always lower during 2-back condition. Motor performance is reduced when adding a concomitant demanding memory task to a prolonged isometric exercise. This can be explained by the interaction of various psychological and neurophysiological factors including higher perceived exertion, greater perturbations of autonomic nervous system activity, and cerebral impairments leading to earlier onset of central fatigue.

On the dynamical behaviour of linear higher-order cellular automata and its decidability								INFORMATION SCIENCES				486				73	87		10.1016/j.ins.2019.02.023			JUN 2019	2019	Higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) are a variant of cellular automata (CA) used in many applications (ranging, for instance, from the design of secret sharing schemes to data compression and image processing), and in which the global state of the system at time t depends not only on the state at time t-1, as in the original model, but also on the states at time t-2, .... t-n, where n is the memory size of the HOCA. We provide decidable characterizations of two important dynamical properties, namely, sensitivity to the initial conditions and equicontinuity, for linear HOCA over the alphabet Z(m). These characterizations have an impact in applications since the involved linear HOCA are usually required to exhibit a chaotic or stable behaviour. Moreover, they extend the ones shown in [28] for linear CA (LCA) over the alphabet Z(m)(n) in the case n = 1. We also show that linear HOCA of memory size n over Z(m)(n) form a class that is indistinguishable from a specific subclass of LCA over Z(m)(n). This enables to decide injectivity and surjectivity for linear HOCA of memory size n over Z(m) using the decidable characterization provided in [2] and [25] for injectivity and surjectivity of LCA over Z(m)(n). Finally, we prove an equivalence between LCA over Z(m)(n) and an important class of non-uniform CA, another variant of CA used in many applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Partnerships have been established to coordinate and collaborate on a single global HFR network (http://global-hfradar.org/) . These partnerships were established in 2012 as part of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) to promote HFR technology and increase data sharing among operators and users. The main product of HFR networks are continuous maps of ocean surface currents within 200 km of the coast at high spatial (1-6 km) and temporal resolution (hourly or higher). Cutting-edge remote sensing technologies are becoming a standard component for ocean observing systems, contributing to the paradigm shift toward ocean monitoring. In 2017 the Global HFR Network was recognized by the Joint Technical WMO-IOC Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) as an observing network of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). In this paper we will discuss the development of the network as well as establishing goals for the future. The U.S. High Frequency Radar Network (HFRNet) has been in operation for over 13 years, with radar data being ingested from 31 organizations including measurements from Canada and Mexico. HFRNet currently holds a collection from over 150 radar installations totaling millions of records of surface ocean velocity measurements. During the past 10 years in Europe, HFR networks have been showing steady growth with over 60 stations currently deployed and many in the planning stage. In Asia and Oceania countries, more than 110 radar stations are in operation. HFR technology can be found in a wide range of applications: for marine safety, oil spill response, tsunami warning, pollution assessment, coastal zone management, tracking environmental change, numerical model simulation of 3-dimensional circulation, and research to generate new understanding of coastal ocean dynamics, depending mainly on each country's coastal sea characteristics. These radar networks are examples of national inter-agency and inter-institutional partnerships for improving oceanographic research and operations. As global partnerships grow, these collaborations and improved data sharing enhance our ability to respond to regional, national, and global environmental and management issues.

We give a generally covariant description of this phenomenon, where the relevant effect turns out to be a quantum superposition of proper times. We point out that if General Relativity is assumed to hold for masses at this scale, measurement of this effect would count as evidence for quantum superposition of spacetime geometries. This interpretation addresses objections appeared in the literature. We observe that the effect sheds light on the Planck mass, and argue that it is very plausibly a real effect.

The depollution of textile industry rejections with this method has not been studied in detail previously. In this work, ceramic membrane filters have been manufactured from natural clay and phosphate mine tailings (phosphate sludge). Blends of the abovementioned materials with a pore-forming agent (sawdust, up to 20 wt. %) were investigated in the range 900-1100 degrees C using thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and mercury porosimetry. Ceramic properties were measured as a function of firing temperature and sawdust addition. Filtration tests were carried out on samples with advantageous properties. The results showed that gehlenite together with diopside neoformed from lime decomposed carbonates and breakdown products of clay minerals, while calcium phosphate derived from partial decomposition of fluorapatite. Both quartz and fluorapatite resisted heating. The results of the experimental design showed that the variations of physical properties versus processing factors were well described by the polynomial model. Filtration results are quite interesting, allowing these membranes to be used in industrial effluent treatment.

However, their full exploitation demands for cheap materials and versatile fabrication methods, extendible over large surfaces and potentially C-MOS compatible. Here, a sol-gel deposition and nanoimprint lithography method is used to obtain titania-based Mie resonators over large areas (several square millimeters), showing that this platform can potentially be exploited for light management with different devices. First, their use for structural colors and efficient band pass filters covering the visible spectrum is demonstrated. Then, exploiting sharp Fano resonances in reflection, their potential for refractive index sensing is addressed obtaining a figure of merit of approximate to 20. Finally, when placing the resonators on porous silica, a large and reversible color tuning can be produced as a result of water adsorption within the substrate porosity. These results open the path to titania sub-micrometric structures for applications as a multifunctional metamaterial for smart windows, displays, and all-optical sensing.

U(VI) acetate. selected to be independently investigated by various spectroscopic (vibrational, luminescence, X-ray absorption, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and quantum chemical methods was achieved by an international round-robin test (RRT). Twenty laboratories from six different countries with a focus on actinide or geochemical research participated and contributed to this scientific endeavor. The outcomes of this RRT were considered on two levels of complexity: first, within each technical discipline, conformities as well as discrepancies of the results and their sources were evaluated. The raw data from the different experimental approaches were found to be generally consistent. In particular, for complex setups such as accelerator-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the agreement between the raw data was high. By contrast, luminescence spectroscopic data turned out to be strongly related to the chosen acquisition parameters. Second, the potentials and limitations of coupling various spectroscopic and theoretical approaches for the comprehensive study of actinide molecular complexes were assessed. Previous spectroscopic data from the literature were revised and the benchmark data on the U(VI) acetate system provided an unambiguous molecular interpretation based on the correlation of spectroscopic and theoretical results.

In fact, five of the six of the CEMAC countries are oil producers. Based on interrupted time series modeling, the analysis shows that the unanticipated changes in oil prices immediately led to a decline in the level of their foreign exchange reserves. The trend is also decreasing. The model predicts a continued degradation of these reserves if oil prices remain low. In these conditions, the CEMAC could experience a currency crisis if economic policies implemented in this region do not lead to a return of economic growth.

Methods: Fifteen children with inactive JIA and fifteen healthy controls were matched by sex, biological age, and Tanner stage. Participants completed a submaximal incremental exercise test to determine their fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates. Results: Between the two groups, heart rate values and carbohydrate oxidation rates were the same, regardless of the relative intensity of exercise. Lipid oxidation rates were lower in JIA patients, regardless of the percentage of VO2 peak (p < 0.05). Respiratory exchange ratios beyond 50% of VO2 peak were higher in patients with JIA (p < 0.05). Respective maximal fat oxidation rates (MFO) for controls and children with JIA were 218.7 +/- 92.2 vs. 157.5 +/- 65.9 mg . min(-1) (p = 0.03) and 4.9 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.2 mg . min(-1) . kg(-1) (p = 0.04). There was no difference between the two groups in heart rate, percentage of VO2 peak, or power of exercise to achieve MFO. Controls reached their MFO at an exercise power significantly higher than did JIA subjects (42.8 +/- 16.8 and 31.9 +/- 9.8 W, p = 0.004). Conclusion: Children with JIA show metabolic disturbance during exercise, even when the disease is considered inactive. This disturbance is seen in a lower lipid oxidation rate during submaximal exercise.

Single crystals of T2-Al2MgC2 were extracted by evaporating the Mg-Al matrix. The crystal structure of T2-Al2MgC2 was refined for the first time on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal is trigonal (space group P-3m1, Z = 1) with lattice parameters of a = 3.3767(11) angstrom, c = 5.807(2) angstrom and V = 57.34(5) angstrom(3). Based on the refined crystal structure, DFT calculations were conducted to evaluate the thermodynamic properties and the electronic structure of the phase. The heat of formation of T2-Al2MgC2 was calculated to be -23.6 kJ/mol of atoms at 298 K. The heat capacity of T2-Al2MgC2 was measured by DSC from 300 to 871 K and calculated by DFT from 0 to 1000 K. Based on the calculated heat capacity, the entropy of formation of the phase at 298 K was determined to be 70.0 J/mol/K. The band structure and the electronic density of state of T2-Al2MgC2 was calculated leading to an indirect band gap value of 1.73 eV.

J	Leroux, Xavier								'Deum tolles ex oculis', or the impossible compromise between mystery and tragedy								STUDI FRANCESI				63	2			271	283					MAY-AUG 2019	2019	As it enabled a straightforward dialogue between God and mankind, the presence of the divinity on the stage of a mystery play, back in the Middle Ages, both appeared like a feature of this theatrical genre and established a fundamental difference with tragedy. This study compares three plays written in the late 15th century and the 16th century, staging the sacrifice of Isaac, and proves how the representation of God on stage forbids any possibility of a transcendent Hereafter, the essential condition for the emergence of tragedy. With such an arrangement, the theatrical universe of mystery plays leads the divinity to justify His decisions, while entertaining a horizontal relationship with the other character. In mystery plays, the balance thus tips towards divine immanence, at the expense of transcendence - the latter, claimed by the Reformation, being necessary to the rebirth of tragedy. It then comes as no surprise that 16th-century humanists, who rejected this genre so closely linked with the theatre of the Middle Ages, felt the need to exclude God from the theatrical area, in order to break away from the medieval tradition and revive the precepts from the Antiquity. Among them, the expression Multa tolles ex oculis, borrowed from Horace, can be modified into a hypothetical Deum tolles ex oculis, thus underlining the transition from mystery plays to tragedy.

We propose an analytical framework to evaluate the role of dispersal during early life stages that considers the actual hydrodynamic connectivity in the Mediterranean Sea, as a factor shaping the population structure of demersal fishes. To this purpose, and to test different scenarios of gene flow, genotypes of individuals of Pagellus erythrinus sampled at 12 sites in the central Mediterranean Sea were analyzed at ten microsatellite loci. The results show the lack of genetic structure in western Mediterranean basin and a pattern of gene flow that deviates from an isolation by distance model. The observed gene flow estimates appear to be scale-dependent. At local scale, it is likely the result of multifactorial components, whereas at a larger scale it is mainly driven by the sea currents, directly influencing dispersal of larvae between sites not reachable by adult movements. Our results stress the importance of a quantitative analysis of potential early life stage dispersal in any study focusing on the population structure of fishes with a long larval stage.

Fault diagnosis, especially online fault diagnosis, has been considered as one of the crucial techniques to break through these two bottlenecks. Although a large number of works dedicated fuel cell diagnosis have been published, the criteria of diagnosis, especially online diagnosis have not yet been clarified. In this study, we firstly propose the criteria used for evaluating a diagnosis strategy. Based on that, we experimentally demonstrate an online fault diagnosis strategy designed for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) systems. The diagnosis approach is designed based on advanced feature extraction and pattern classification techniques, and realized by processing individual fuel cell voltage signals. We also develop a highly integrated electronic chip with multiplexing and high-speed computing capabilities to fulfill the precise measurement of multi-channel signals. Furthermore, we accomplish the diagnosis algorithm in real-time. The excellent performance in both diagnosis accuracy and speediness over multiple fuel cell systems is verified. The proposed strategy is promising to be utilized in various fuel cell systems and promote the commercialization of fuel cell technology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The paradigm compares a human social interaction (human-human interaction, HHI) to an interaction with a conversational robot (human-robot interaction, HRI). The social interaction consists of 1 min blocks of live bidirectional discussion between the scanned participant and the human or robot agent. A final sample of 21 participants is included in the corpus comprising physiological (blood oxygen level-dependent, respiration and peripheral blood flow) and behavioural (recorded speech from all interlocutors, eye tracking from the scanned participant, face recording of the human and robot agents) data. Here, we present the first analysis of this corpus, contrasting neural activity between HHI and HRI. We hypothesized that independently of differences in behaviour between interactions with the human and robot agent, neural markers of mentalizing (temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex) and social motivation (hypothalamus and amygdala) would only be active in HHI. Results confirmed significantly increased response associated with HHI in the TPJ, hypothalamus and amygdala, but not in the medial prefrontal cortex. Future analysis of this corpus will include fine-grained characterization of verbal and non-verbal behaviours recorded during the interaction to investigate their neural correlates. This article is part of the theme issue 'From social brains to social robots: applying neurocognitive insights to human-robot interaction'.

Some of these technologies have been available for years while others have only recently emerged. Use of these technologies is critical to improve understanding of the processes that control abundances, distributions and composition of plankton, provide data necessary to constrain and improve ecosystem and biogeochemical models, and forecast changes in marine ecosystems in light of climate change. In this paper we begin by providing the motivation for plankton observations, quantification and diversity qualification on a global scale. We then expand on the state-of-the-art, detailing a variety of relevant and (mostly) mature technologies and measurements, including bulk measurements of plankton, pigment composition, uses of genomic, optical and acoustical methods as well as analysis using particle counters, flow cytometers and quantitative imaging devices. We follow by highlighting the requirements necessary for a plankton observing system, the approach to achieve it and associated challenges. We conclude with ranked action-item recommendations for the next 10 years to move toward our vision of a holistic ocean-wide plankton observing system. Particularly, we suggest to begin with a demonstration project on a GO-SHIP line and/or a long-term observation site and expand from there, ensuring that issues associated with methods, observation tools, data analysis, quality assessment and curation are addressed early in the implementation. Global coordination is key for the success of this vision and will bring new insights on processes associated with nutrient regeneration, ocean production, fisheries and carbon sequestration.

J	Liu, Hongguang; Han, Muxin								Asymptotic analysis of spin foam amplitude with timelike triangles								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				99	8					084040	10.1103/PhysRevD.99.084040			APR 24 2019	2019	The large-j asymptotic behavior of the four-dimensional spin foam amplitude is investigated for the extended spin foam model (Conrady-Hnybida extension) on a simplicial complex. We study the most general situation in which timelike tetrahedra with timelike triangles are taken into account. The large- j asymptotic behavior is determined by the critical configurations of the amplitude. We identify the critical configurations that correspond to the Lorentzian simplicial geometries with timelike tetrahedra and triangles. Their contributions to the amplitude are asymptotic phases, whose exponents equal the Regge action of gravity. The amplitude may also contains critical configurations corresponding to nondegenerate split signature 4-simplices and degenerate vector geometries. But vertex amplitudes containing at least one timelike and one spacelike tetrahedra only give Lorentzian 4-simplices, while the split signature or degenerate 4-simplex does not appear.

Reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) is a paradigm that is able to meet these challenges due to its scalability and integrability. In this paper, we aim to solve the multi-objective sustainable process plan generation problem in a reconfigurable environment. In addition to the total production cost and the completion time, we use the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted during the manufacturing process as a sustainability criterion. We propose an iterative multi-objective integer linear programming (I-MOILP) approach and its comparison with adapted versions of the two well-known evolutionary algorithms, respectively, the Archived Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (AMOSA) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). Moreover, we study the influence of the probabilities of genetic operators on the convergence of the adapted NSGA-II. To illustrate the applicability of the three approaches, an example is presented and obtained numerical results analysed.

For that purpose, knowledge of the optical effects induced by the neighborhood of a given seabed target and by the water column itself is required to better interpret the subsurface upward radiance measured by satellite or shipborne radiometers. In this paper, the various sources of photons that contribute to the subsurface upward radiance are analyzed. In particular, the adjacency effects caused by the neighborhood of a given seabed target are quantified for three water turbidity conditions, namely clear, moderately turbid and turbid waters. Firstly, an analytical expression of the subsurface radiance is proposed in order to make explicit the radiance terms corresponding to these effects. Secondly, a sensitivity study is performed using radiative transfer modeling to determine the influence of the seabed adjacency effects on the upward signal with respect to various parameters such as the bathymetry or the bottom brightness. The results show that the highest contributions of the adjacency effects induced by the neighborhood of a seabed target to the subsurface radiance could reach 26%, 18% and 9% for clear, moderately turbid and turbid water conditions respectively. Therefore, the detection of a seabed target could be significantly biased if the seabed adjacency effects are ignored in the analysis of remote sensing measurements. Our results could be further used to improve the performance of inverse algorithms dedicated to the retrieval of bottom composition, water optical properties and/or bathymetry.

Considering a simple FI-SC interface model, we derive formulas for the spin current and spin-current noise induced by microwave irradiation (spin pumping) or the temperature gradient (the spin Seebeck effect). We show how the superconducting coherence factor affects the temperature dependence of the spin current. We also calculate the spin-current noise in thermal equilibrium and in nonequilibrium states induced by the spin pumping and compare them quantitatively for an yttrium iron garnet-NbN interface.

However, processes and factors controlling these transfers and transformations are not well constrained, particularly with respect to land use effect. We compared C and IN concentrations in shallow groundwater and first-order streams of a sandy lowland catchment dominated by two types of land use: pine forest and maize cropland. Contrary to forest groundwater, crop groundwater exhibited oxic conditions all-year round as a result of higher evapotranspiration and better lateral drainage that decreased the water table below the organic-rich soil horizon, prevented the leaching of soil-generated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater, and thus limited consumption of dissolved oxygen (O-2). In crop groundwater, oxic conditions inhibited denitrification and methanogenesis resulting in high nitrate (NO3-; on average 1140 +/- 485 mu mol L-1) and low methane (CH4; 40 +/- 25 nmol L-1) concentrations. Conversely, anoxic conditions in forest groundwater led to lower NO3- (25 +/- 40 mu mol L-1) and higher CH4 (1770 +/- 1830 nmol L-1) concentrations. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2); 30,650 +/- 11,590 ppmv) in crop groundwater was significantly lower than in forest groundwater (50,630 +/- 26,070 ppmv), and was apparently caused by the deeper water table delaying downward diffusion of soil CO2 to the water table. In contrast, pCO(2) was not significantly different in crop (4480 +/- 2680 ppmv) and forest (4900 +/- 4500 ppmv) streams, suggesting faster degassing in forest streams resulting from greater water turbulence. Although NO3- concentrations indicated that denitrification occurred in riparian-forest groundwater, crop streams nevertheless exhibited important signs of spring and summer eutrophication such as the development of macrophytes. Stream eutrophication favored development of anaerobic conditions in crop stream sediments, as evidenced by increased ammonia (NH4+) and CH4 in stream waters and concomitant decreased in NO3- concentrations as a result of sediment denitrification. In crop streams, dredging and erosion of streambed sediments during winter sustained high concentration of particulate organic C, NH4+ and CH4. In forest streams, dissolved iron (Fe2+), NH4+ and CH4 were negatively correlated with O-2 reflecting the gradual oxygenation of stream water and associated oxidations of Fe2+, NH4+ and CH4. The results overall showed that forest groundwater behaved as source of CO2 and CH4 to streams, the intensity depending on the hydrological connectivity among soils, groundwater, and streams. CH4 production was prevented in cropland in soils and groundwater, however crop groundwater acted as a source of CO2 to streams (but less so than forest groundwater). Conversely, in streams, pCO(2) was not significantly affected by land use while CH4 production was enhanced by cropland. At the catchment scale, this study found substantial biogeochemical heterogeneity in C and IN concentrations between forest and crop waters, demonstrating the importance of including the full vegetation-groundwater-stream continuum when estimating land-water fluxes of C (and nitrogen) and attempting to understand their spatial and temporal dynamics.

J	Ginoux, Jean-Marc; Naeck, Roomila; Ruhomally, Yusra Bibi; Dauhoo, Muhammad Zaid; Perc, Matjaz								Chaos in a predator-prey-based mathematical model for illicit drug consumption								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				347				502	513		10.1016/j.amc.2018.10.089			APR 15 2019	2019	Recently, a mathematical model describing the illicit drug consumption in a population consisting of drug users and non-users has been proposed. The model describes the dynamics of non-users, experimental users, recreational users, and addict users within a population. The aim of this work is to propose a modified version of this model by analogy with the classical predator-prey models, in particular considering non-users as prey and users as predator. Hence, our model includes a stabilizing effect of the growth rate of the prey, and a destabilizing effect of the predator saturation. Functional responses of Verhulst and of Holling type II have been used for modeling these effects. To forecast the marijuana consumption in the states of Colorado and Washington, we used data from Hanley (2013) and a genetic algorithm to calibrate the parameters in our model. Assuming that the population of non-users increases in proportion with the demography, and following the seminal works of Sir Robert May (1976), we use the growth rate of non-users as the main bifurcation parameter. For the state of Colorado, the model first exhibits a limit cycle, which agrees quite accurately with the reported periodic data in Hanley (2013). By further increasing the growth rate of non-users, the population then enters into two chaotic regions, within which the evolution of the variables becomes unpredictable. For the state of Washington, the model also exhibits a periodic solution, which is again in good agreement with observed data. A chaotic region for Washington is likewise observed in the bifurcation diagram. Our research confirms that mathematical models can be a useful tool for better understanding illicit drug consumption, and for guiding policy-makers towards more effective policies to contain this epidemic.

Controlling a Chemical Coupling Reaction on a Surface: Tools and Strategies for On-Surface Synthesis								CHEMICAL REVIEWS				119	7			4717	4776		10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00601			APR 10 2019	2019	On-surface synthesis is appearing as an extremely promising research field aimed at creating new organic materials. A large number of chemical reactions have been successfully demonstrated to take place directly on surfaces through unusual reaction mechanisms. In some cases the reaction conditions can be properly tuned to steer the formation of the reaction products. It is thus possible to control the initiation step of the reaction and its degree of advancement (the kinetics, the reaction yield); the nature of the reaction products (selectivity control, particularly in the case of competing processes); as well as the structure, position, and orientation of the covalent compounds, or the quality of the as-formed networks in terms of order and extension. The aim of our review is thus to provide an extensive description of all tools and strategies reported to date and to put them into perspective. We specifically define the different approaches available and group them into a few general categories. In the last part, we demonstrate the effective maturation of the on-surface synthesis field by reporting systems that are getting closer to application relevant levels thanks to the use of advanced control strategies.

Supramolecular chemistry has enabled the construction of triangular assemblies, many of which possess functional features. Among these structures, cucurbiturils have been used to build supramolecular triangles, and we recently reported paramagnetic cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) triangles, but the reasons for their formation remain unclear. Several parameters have now been identified to explain their formation. At first sight, the radical nature of the guest was of prime importance in obtaining the triangles, and we focused on extending this concept to biradicals to get supramolecular hexaradicals. Two sodium ions were systematically observed by ESI-MS in trimer structures, and the presence of Na+ triggered or strengthened the triangulation of CB[8]/guest 1:1 complexes in solution. X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling have allowed the proposal of two plausible sites of residence for the two sodium cations. We then found that a diamagnetic guest with an H-bond acceptor function is equally good at forming CB[8] triangles. Hence, a guest molecule containing a ketone function has been precisely triangulated thanks to CB[8] and sodium cations as determined by DOSY-NMR and DLS. A binding constant for the triangulation of 1:1 to 3:3 complexes is proposed. This concept has finally been extended to the triangulation of ditopic guests toward network formation by the reticulation of CB[8] triangles using dinitroxide biradicals.

On a global scale, wet deposition accounts for about 80% of the total atmospheric BC inputs to the ocean. The input of BC particles to the ocean can enrich surface waters with carbon and associated elements, and owing to high porosity and surface-active properties, BC can alter biogeochemical cycles by sorbing dissolved compounds and promoting aggregation. The rain-mediated input of BC to the ocean and its consequences on nutrient concentrations and particle dynamics were studied in Halong Bay, Vietnam, during a 24-h cycle impacted by short and heavy rainfall events. This study suggests that once introduced in the surface ocean via wet deposition, BC sorbs dissolved organic matter (DOM) and stimulates aggregation processes. The observed wet deposition events were characterized by sudden and pulsed inputs of BC particles that created a thin layer of sinking surface-active aggregates, acting as a net-like scavenger for DOM, nutrients (especially phosphate), and small particles. In addition, the wet deposition events coincided with an enrichment of nutrients in the surface microlayer, with an excess input of nitrogen relative to phosphorus leading to an increase of the molar N:P ratio from 24:1 to 37:1. In the underlying water, the molar N: P ratio also increased (i.e., from 39:1 to 64:1), and this can be attributed to the preferential scavenging of dissolved P-compounds on sinking BC-aggregates.

Measurements of metabolic activities of bathypelagic bacteria are often underestimated due to the technological limitations in recovering samples and maintaining them under in situ environmental conditions. Moreover, most of the pressure-retaining samplers, developed by a number of different labs, able to maintain seawater samples at in situ pressure during recovery have remained at the prototype stage, and therefore not available to the scientific community. In this paper, we will describe a ready-to-use pressure-retaining sampler, which can be adapted to use on a CTD-carousel sampler. As well as being able to recover samples under in situ high pressure (up to 60 MPa) we propose a sample processing in equi-pressure mode. Using a piloted pressure generator, we present how to perform sub-sampling and transfer of samples in equi-pressure mode to obtain replicates and perform hyperbaric experiments safely and efficiently (with <2% pressure variability). As proof of concept, we describe a field application (prokaryotic activity measurements and incubation experiment) with samples collected at 3,000m-depth in the Mediterranean Sea. Sampling, sub-sampling, transfer, and incubations were performed under in situ high pressure conditions and compared to those performed following decompression and incubation at atmospheric pressure. Three successive incubations were made for each condition using direct dissolved-oxygen concentration measurements to determine the incubation times. Subsamples were collected at the end of each incubation to monitor the prokaryotic diversity, using 16S-rDNA/rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Our results demonstrated that oxygen consumption by prokaryotes is always higher under in situ conditions than after decompression and incubation at atmospheric pressure. In addition, over time, the variations in the prokaryotic community composition and structure are seen to be driven by the different experimental conditions. Finally, within samples maintained under in situ high pressure conditions, the active (16S rRNA) prokaryotic community was dominated by sequences affiliated with rare families containing piezophilic isolates, such as Oceanospirillaceae or Colwelliaceae. These results demonstrate the biological importance of maintaining in situ conditions during and after sampling in deep-sea environments.

We show that in all these models a geometric criterion, represented by a minimal length (l) over bar (min), determines the onset of prestresses and rigidity. This allows us to predict not only the correct scalings for the elastic material properties, but also the precise magnitudes for bulk modulus and shear modulus discontinuities at the rigidity transition as well as the magnitude of the Poynting effect. We also predict from first principles that the ratio of the excess shear modulus to the shear stress should be inversely proportional to the critical strain with a prefactor of 3. We propose that this factor of 3 is a general hallmark of geometrically induced rigidity in underconstrained materials and could be used to distinguish this effect from nonlinear mechanics of single components in experiments. Finally, our results may lay important foundations for ways to estimate (l) over bar (min) from measurements of local geometric structure and thus help develop methods to characterize large-scale mechanical properties from imaging data.

Since then, giant viruses of amoeba enlightened an unknown part of the viral world, and every discovery and characterization of a new giant virus modifies our perception of the virosphere. This notably includes their exceptional virion sizes from 200 nm to 2 mu m and their genomic complexity with length, number of genes, and functions such as translational components never seen before. Even more surprising, Mimivirus possesses a unique mobilome composed of virophages, transpovirons, and a defense system against virophages named Mimivirus virophage resistance element (MIMIVIRE). From the discovery and isolation of new giant viruses to their possible roles in humans, this review shows the active contribution of the University Hospital Institute (IHU) Mediterranee Infection to the growing knowledge of the giant viruses' field.

Here, we demonstrate a new approach, all based on self-assembly, for the ordering of 2D arrays of nanodots over several cm(2) sized, crystalline silicon wafers. Via block copolymer-micelles-assisted sol-gel deposition of TiO2 on Si and thermal annealing, we prepare the substrates with inorganic nanopatterns featuring hexagonally positioned perforations homogeneously sized and spaced. These templates are used to selectively form individual nanodots in each perforation featuring typical size of 17 +/- 2 nm for the Ge and 28 +/- 5 nm for the Au particles. The process developed in this study paves the way to a scalable self-organization of nanoparticles for various applications. We mainly focused on the use of Ge dots as quantum dots for optoelectronic applications, proving the high crystalline quality of the system. But we also demonstrate that the process can be applied to Au dots, often used as catalyst for vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanowires or plasmonic particles.

First, it analyses whether the decision to migrate relies upon individual characteristics. Second, it examines the ways in which the economic, social and environmental characteristics of the French territories determine the retirees' choice of localization. The paper draws upon a unique database of 12.67 million French inhabitants, with information about their personal attributes and locational choices from 2003 to 2008. It also uses an original database with locational characteristics for the French territories at the level of the 364 zones d'emploi. This is the only study on regional migration in France which builds upon such a thin spatial level of analysis. The paper builds empirical probit and Heckman models dealing with selection bias and endogeneity bias issues. The paper shows that retirees usually leave large agglomerations and old industrial areas in Northern France and the Paris agglomeration and relocate to socially and environmentally attractive zones with preferable climates. When studying the migration patterns within the zones d'emploi, it appears that the most vulnerable zones, which display a lower quality of collective services as well as higher income disparities and crime rates, feature lower elderly residential mobility.

A quantification algorithm is derived, namely, the volume fraction estimation algorithm that is applied to two experimental data sets acquired in the Mediterranean Sea during the POLLUPROOF'2015 exercise and in the North Sea during the NOFO'2015 experiment using the Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aeraspatiales airborne L-hand SETHI system.

We made use of several kinds of multi-sensor in situ observations located along SARAL and Jason-2 tracks. The main objectives of the study were to assess improved coastal oriented validation strategies, including the usage of a new in situ platform (Moving Vessel Profiler), while better understanding potential differences owing to physical content inconsistency and instrumental or data processing limitations. The results show remarkable agreements over spatial scales of few tens of kilometres, paving the way for the deployment of future in situ networks and the definition of science-oriented diagnostics targeted to assess the capability of present and future high-resolution altimetric missions in resolving small-scale physical features.

Results showed that compound 3 exhibited interesting antibiofilm efficiencies effective concentrations (EC50) in the range of 30-100 mu mol l(-1) without acute toxicity against bacteria. Toxicity against nontargeted organisms was also considered showing that the compound did not affect the global bacterial community at a concentration of 75-100 mu mol l(-1). These results provided baseline data concerning the toxicity of antibiofilm biocides against marine organisms. Significance and Impact of the Study This study reports relevant information about antibiofilm activity of original derivatives of hemibastadin alkaloids. The most active compound was shown to act as a specific anti-biofilm inhibitor without affecting viability of the targeted bacteria no more than those of the global bacterial community of a seawater sample. Taken together, these findings indicate the potentiality of such compounds to be used as original nonbiocidal molecules for designing eco-friendly antifouling solutions.

Deep level transient spectroscopy and electrical simulations were used to investigate the deep levels response in two devices with the same gate surface area but with gate lengths of 15 and 1 mu m. Results reveal that the repartition of equipotential lines depends on the gate length and impacts trapping phenomena. We demonstrated that the concentration of the defects localized beneath the gate electrode and associated with etching induced damage is reduced with a short gate length. Furthermore, for a negative gate voltage, the depletion region is less extended toward the buffer layers with a gate length of 1 mu m, meaning that the trapping effects are reduced. Finally, this work indicates that it is better to design transistors with a short gate length to moderate the effect of trapping phenomena.

We locate the essential spectrum under the hypothesis that the projection of the tangent vector of the curve to the direction of the segment admits a (possibly unbounded) limit at infinity and state sufficient conditions which guarantee the existence of discrete eigenvalues. We justify the optimality of these conditions by establishing a spectral stability in opposite regimes. In particular, Hardy-type inequalities are derived in the regime of repulsive shearing.

J	Kantha, Lakshmi; Luce, Hubert; Hashiguchi, Hiroyuki; Doddi, Abhiram								Atmospheric structures in the troposphere as revealed by high-resolution backscatter images from MU radar operating in range-imaging mode								PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE				6						32	10.1186/s40645-019-0274-1			MAR 29 2019	2019	VHF band stratosphere/troposphere (ST) radars around the globe are seldom operated in range-imaging mode. As such, the typical range resolution of their backscatter images is about 150m. The only exception is the Kyoto University's Middle and Upper Atmosphere (MU) radar in Shigaraki, Japan. Range imaging using frequency diversity was implemented there in 2005 and has often been used since then. During the Shigaraki UAV Radar Experiment (ShUREX) campaigns in the spring/summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017, the MU radar was operated in range-imaging mode to provide a range resolution of typically 20m, for good signal to noise (SNR) ratios. The resulting Capon backscatter images revealed a variety of atmospheric structures in the moist troposphere in great detail. They were also quite useful in deploying in situ sensors on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to probe such structures in near real time guided by the images. The goal of this paper is to present and discuss some such structures of interest to atmospheric dynamics collectively, to provide an overarching view. They include Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) billows generated by shear instability, mid-level cloud-base turbulence (MCT) layers generated by convective instability in a moist troposphere, convective boundary layer (CBL), and sheet and layer (S&L) structures in a stably stratified atmospheric column. Videos of radar images collected during the 2015 and 2016 campaigns are included as Additional file 1 to demonstrate the fascinating, ever-changing evolution of atmospheric structures over the MU radar.

Midlevel Cloud-Base Turbulence: Radar Observations and Models								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES				124	6			3223	3245		10.1029/2018JD029479			MAR 27 2019	2019	Midlevel Cloud-base Turbulence (MCT) caused by ice/snow precipitation from midlevel clouds falling into dry air below the cloud base and sublimating is investigated. MCT phenomena in the lower troposphere as revealed by the Middle and Upper atmosphere (MU) radar in Shigaraki, Japan, during the Shigaraki unmanned aerial vehicle and radar Experiment campaigns in the spring-summer of 2015 and 2016 are described. The MU radar was operated in a high-resolution (similar to 20-m) range imaging mode and hence revealed the structure of these MCTs in great detail. These MCT layers grew to hundreds of meters in thickness, often reaching nearly 2,000m in depth, lasting often for as much as 24hr. A simple analytical model and a second-moment closure-based turbulent mixing model are used to estimate the levels of turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate in the MCT layer and compare them to those measured by the MU radar. The study shows that MCT can give rise to moderate levels of turbulence of potential interest to aviation, confirming conclusions reached by earlier pioneering studies. However, to our knowledge, this important process has not received the attention it deserves by the atmospheric community so far, and therefore, it is the principal goal of this paper to not only present some observations and preliminary modeling results, but also redraw the attention of atmospheric scientists to this important process. Plain Language Summary The free atmosphere above the planetary boundary layer is stably stratified, and therefore, turbulent mixing there is shear driven and occurs generally under the influence of stable density stratification. However, convective mixing can also occur there under certain conditions. When precipitating snow/ice particles fall below the cloud base of midlevel clouds, they can sublimate if the air column below the cloud is dry enough. The resulting cooling of the air column drives vigorous convection. This midlevel cloud-base turbulence process is the subject of this article.

Abiotic degradation of highly branched isoprenoid alkenes and other lipids in the water column off East Antarctica								MARINE CHEMISTRY				210				34	47		10.1016/j.marchem.2019.02.004			MAR 20 2019	2019	In some previous studies, the ratio between a di-unsaturated highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) lipid termed IPSO25 and a structurally related tri-unsaturated counterpart (HBI III) (viz. IPSO25/HBI III) has been used as a proxy measure of variable sea ice cover in the Antarctic owing to their production by certain sea ice algae and open water diatoms, respectively. To investigate this further, we quantified selected lipids and their photo- and autoxidation products in samples of suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected at different water depths in the polynya region west of the Dalton Iceberg Tongue (East Antarctica). The results obtained confirm the high efficiency of photo- and autoxidation processes in diatoms from the region. The systematic increase of the ratio IPSO25/HBI III with water depth in the current samples appeared to be dependent on the sampling site and was due to both (i) a relatively higher contribution of ice algae to the deeper samples resulting from their increased aggregation and therefore higher sinking rate, or (ii) a stronger abiotic degradation of HBI III during settling through the water column. Analyses of samples taken from the water-sediment interface and some underlying near-surface sediments revealed a further increase of the ratio IPSO25/HBI III, indicative of further differential oxidation of the more unsaturated HBI. Unfortunately, specific oxidation products of HBI III could not be detected in the strongly oxidized SPM and sediment samples, likely due to their lability towards further oxidation. In contrast, oxidation products of HBI HI were detected in weakly oxidized samples of phytoplanktonic cells collected from Commonwealth Bay (also East Antarctica), thus providing more direct evidence for the involvement of photo- and/or autoxidation of HBI III in the region. This oxidative alteration of the ratio IPSO25/HBI III between their source and sedimentary environments might need to be considered more carefully when using this parameter for palaeo sea ice reconstruction purposes in the Antarctic.

In this study, the role of groundwater discharge and porewater fluxes in supporting primary production of coastal lagoons was evaluated by stable nitrogen and carbon isotope signature tracing of the transfer of nitrogen and carbon to primary producers. We determined the isotope signatures in macrophytes and phytoplankton (via particulate organic matter) and in the potential sources of inorganic nitrogen and carbon in two coastal lagoons on the French Mediterranean coastline. The delta N-15 of both macrophytes and phytoplankton reflect predominantly the nitrogen isotopic signatures of the karstic ground-water and porewater sources, indicating that they must have sourced the majority of their nitrogen from these sources, with punctual contributions from sewage input characterised by a significantly different isotopic signature. The delta C-13 signature of primary producers also shows the contribution of karstic groundwater discharge and porewater exchange as significant sources of dissolved inorganic carbon to primary production. This study links physical (nutrient delivery) and ecological (nutrient uptake) processes associated with primary production, thereby providing direct evidence for the ecological role groundwater discharge and porewater fluxes can play in coastal ecosystems.

Two MiniFluos can be installed on a glider, each equipped with two optical channels (one PAH is measured per channel). This setup allows the measurement of up to 4 different fluorescent PAHs: Naphthalene, Phenanthrene, Fluorene and Pyrene. Laboratory tests on oil products (Maya crude oil and Diesel fuel) as well as on marine samples near industrial areas (urban harbor and offshore installations) revealed that the concentration of the four PAHs targeted accounted for 62-97% of the total PAH concentration found in samples (Sigma 16 PAHs determined by standard international protocols). Laboratory tests also revealed that for marine applications, the calibration on Water Accommodated Fraction (WAF) of crude oil is more appropriate than the one on pure standards (STD). This is because PAH fluorescence is constituted in large part of alkylated compounds that are not considered with STD calibration. Results from three glider deployments with increasing levels of complexity (a laboratory trial, a field mission in non-autonomous mode and a fully autonomous mission) are also presented. During field deployments, the MiniFluo-glider package was able to detect concentration gradients from offshore marine waters toward the head of a Mediterranean harbor ( < 80 ng L-1) as well as hydrocarbon patches at the surface waters of an oil and gas exploitation field in the North Sea (< 200 ng L-1, mainly Naphthalene). It is suggested that using only the WAF calibration, the concentration derived with the MiniFluo agrees within one order of magnitude with the concentration determined by Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (overestimation by a factor 7 on average). These performances can be improved if the calibration is made with a WAF with PAH proportions similar to the one find in the environment. Finally, it is shown that the use of in situ calibration on water samples collected during the glider deployment, when possible, gives the best results.

J	Romdhane, Mohamed Salah; Fassatoui, Chiheb; Shaiek, Moez; Jenhani, Amel Ben Rejeb; Changeux, Thomas								Mugilids fisheries of Tunisian coasts and lagoons								AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES				32						6	10.1051/alr/2019005			MAR 18 2019	2019	With its 1300 km coastline and 110 000 ha of coastal lagoons, Tunisia offers important resources to demersal and pelagic fisheries. Among all the exploited fish species in Tunisia, mugilids are the most widespread. They are known in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions, and occur both in coastal areas, lagoon ecosystems and inland waters. Six mugilids species have been inventoried in Tunisia. Their migratory behavior consists of moving back and forth between brackish and saline environment where they spend a large part of their life cycles. This behavior results in a peculiar high vulnerability to human pressure. Consequently, they require special attention from fisheries managers for sustainable catches. This study was based on the data from the national fishing and aquaculture directorate (DGPA) statistics, and comprised time series from 1995 to 2015. We looked for clear tendencies and correlations between harvest from the coastal sea and lagoons of the different coastal regions, in relation to recruitment in coastal marine waters. We focused on two species, i.e. Mugil cephalus and Liza aurata, which are best appreciated for local consumption and, therefore, most targeted by the fishery in Tunisia. The Tunisian lagoons show a decreasing trend in mugilids landings. This may be explained by the disturbance of migratory ways and the degradation of the coastal habitats, by the harvest of fry used for the inland water-stocking program, and by the multiplication of droughts. Particularly the latter strongly limits the migration of juveniles. The harvest in the coastal zones is relatively stable, follows perfectly the total national landings, with although a clear increase since 2011 as a result of uncontrolled illegal fishing. The negative correlation between the total harvests of mugilids in the coastal sea and coastal lagoon was highly significant (Pearson coefficient r = -0.702, p < 0.001).

The resulting discrete-time dynamics is thus not only manifestly unitary, but also ultralocal, i.e., the particle's speed is upper bounded, as in standard relativistic quantum field theories. The lattice chiral symmetry of staggered fermions, which corresponds to a translational invariance, is lost after the requirement of ultralocality of the evolution; this fact is an instance of Meyer's 1996 no-go results stating that no nontrivial scalar quantum cellular automaton can be translationally invariant [D.

Substantial N-2 fixation activity was observed at 8 of the 10 stations sampled, ranging overall from 81 to 384 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1) (0.7 to 8.2 nmol N L-1 d(-1)), with two sites close to the Iberian Margin situated between 38.8 and 40.7 degrees N yielding rates reaching up to 1355 and 1533 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1). Primary production was relatively lower along the Iberian Margin, with rates ranging from 33 to 59 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), while it increased towards the northwest away from the peninsula, reaching as high as 135 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). In agreement with the area-averaged Chl a satellite data contemporaneous with our study period, our results revealed that post-bloom conditions prevailed at most sites, while at the northwesternmost station the bloom was still ongoing. When converted to carbon uptake using Redfield stoichiometry, N-2 fixation could support 1% to 3% of daily PP in the euphotic layer at most sites, except at the two most active sites where this contribution to daily PP could reach up to 25 %. At the two sites where N-2 fixation activity was the highest, the prymnesiophyte-symbiont Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A) dominated the nifH sequence pool, while the remaining recovered sequences belonged to non-cyanobacterial phylotypes. At all the other sites, however, the recovered nifH sequences were exclusively assigned phylogenetically to non-cyanobacterial phylotypes. The intense N-2 fixation activities recorded at the time of our study were likely promoted by the availability of phytoplankton-derived organic matter produced during the spring bloom, as evidenced by the significant surface particulate organic carbon concentrations. Also, the presence of excess phosphorus signature in surface waters seemed to contribute to sustaining N-2 fixation, particularly at the sites with extreme activities. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the unexpectedly high N-2 fixation in productive waters of the temperate North Atlantic and highlight the importance of N-2 fixation for future assessment of the global N inventory.

J	Carret, Alice; Birol, Florence; Estournel, Claude; Zakardjian, Bruno; Testor, Pierre								Synergy between in situ and altimetry data to observe and study Northern Current variations (NW Mediterranean Sea)								OCEAN SCIENCE				15	2			269	290		10.5194/os-15-269-2019			MAR 13 2019	2019	During the last 15 years, substantial progress has been achieved in altimetry data processing, now providing data with enough accuracy to illustrate the potential of these observations for coastal applications. In parallel, new altimetry techniques improve data quality by reducing land contamination and enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. Satellite altimetry provides more robust and accurate measurements ever closer to the coast and resolve shorter ocean signals. An important issue is now to learn how to use altimetry data in conjunction with other coastal observing techniques. Here, we cross-compare and combine the coastal currents provided by large datasets of ship-mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), gliders, high-frequency (HF) radars and altimetry. We analyze how the different available observing techniques, with a particular focus on altimetry, capture the Northern Current variability at different timescales. We also study the coherence, divergence and complementarity of the information derived from the different instruments considered. Two generations of altimetry missions and both 1 Hz and high-rate measurements are used: Jason-2 (nadir Ku-band radar) and SARAL/AltiKa (nadir Ka-band altimetry); their performances are compared. In terms of mean speed of the Northern Current, a very good spatial continuity and coherence is observed at regional scale, showing the complementarity among the types of current measurements. In terms of current variability, there is still a good spatial coherence but the Northern Current amplitudes derived from altimetry, glider, ADCP and HF radar data differ, mainly because of differences in their respective spa-tial and temporal resolutions. If we consider seasonal variations, 1 Hz altimetry captures similar to 60% and similar to 55% of the continental slope current amplitude observed by the gliders and by the ADCPs, respectively. For individual dates this number varies a lot as a function of the characteristics of the Northern Current on the corresponding date, with no clear seasonal tendency observed. Compared to Jason-2, the SARAL altimeter data tend to give estimations of the NC characteristics that are closer to in situ data in a number of cases. The much noisier high-rate altimetry data appear to be more difficult to analyze but they provide current estimates that are generally closer to the other types of current measurements. Thus, satellite altimetry provides a synoptic view of the Northern Current circulation system and variability, which helps to interpret the other observations. Its regular sampling allows for the observation of many features that may be missed by irregular in situ data.

If evidence for this "ego-depletion" effect was initially believed to be strong, it is now questioned. Recent meta-analyses indicated that this effect was sensitive to publication bias and that it was greatly reduced after control for this bias. In a pre-registered replication attempt where an ego-depletion protocol was conducted in multiple independent laboratories, the effect was not distinguishable from zero. Here, a different approach is adopted to examine the validity of this effect by improving the experimental protocol with the addition of important methodological precautions: 1) a pre-test measurement, 2) a learning period, 3) a prolonged depleting task, 4) a similar control condition, and 5) valid indexes of self-control. Accordingly, a well-learned Simon task was done before and after 1 h of continuous practice of a Stroop task in a high inhibition demands condition (75% of incongruent trials) or in a control condition (0% of incongruent trials). Datasets from between-subjects (Study 1, N=82) and within-subjects (Study 2, N=52) experiments were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. A significant ego-depletion effect was found in Study 1 (greater interference effect and accuracy decline in high inhibition demands than in control condition) but not in Study 2. Because it is difficult to explain this difference in results, the findings suggest that, even in a context chosen to optimize the observation of an ego-depletion effect, it seems difficult to be conclusive about the existence of this effect.

This implies that a notion of 'volume entropy' may be introduced on this state space, interpreted as the von Neumann entropy associated to the measurement of volume. However, it also becomes apparent that including the states with vanishing volume eigenvalues this entropy becomes divergent.

J	Grenz, Christian; Moreno, Montserrat Origel; Soetaert, Karline; Denis, Lionel; Douillet, Pascal; Fichez, Renaud								Spatio-temporal variability in benthic exchanges at the sediment-water interface of a shallow tropical coastal lagoon (south coast of Gulf of Mexico)								ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				218				368	380		10.1016/j.ecss.2019.01.012			MAR 5 2019	2019	The sediment in Laguna de Terminos, the largest and shallowest system in the Southwest portion of the Gulf of Mexico features a broad range of ecological and hydrobiological characteristics driven by annual weather cycles (dry and wet seasons), causing large salinity gradients during the wet season due to large river discharges. Four sampling campaigns were carried out during the wet and the dry seasons in 2009 and 2010 on a selection of 13 out of 35 stations. Measurements of Sediment Oxygen Demand (SOD) and nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface were performed using lab incubations with 15 cm diameter sediment cores. SOD fluctuated between 1327 +/- 161 and 2248 +/- 359 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) for dry and wet seasons respectively. Silicate effluxes were also significantly higher during the wet seasons (89.4 +/- 15.9 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) than during the dry season (46.5 +/- 11.4 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). PO4 fluxes were low all over the study period without seasonal trend. No significant difference was measured for DIN fluxes but there was a tendency for DIN uptake during the wet season (-2.9 +/- 18.8 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) and conversely an efflux during the dry season (24.3 +/- 7.3 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). SOD correlated to organic matter and chloropigment content of the sediments while silicate fluxes responded to enhanced chloropigments in the sediments. During both seasons, total benthic nutrient fluxes overwhelmed largely riverine inputs and benthic carbon mineralization rates approximated a significant proportion of the pelagic organic carbon production. We conclude that benthic processes in Laguna de Terminos are largely driven by weather variability and that they contribute substantially to carbon and nutrient budgets in this shallow subtropical system.

However, the dependency of most methods on reference genomes, which are currently unavailable for a substantial fraction of microbial species, introduces estimation biases. We present an updated and functionally extended tool based on universal (i.e., reference-independent), phylogenetic marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) enabling the profiling of > 7700 microbial species. As more than 30% of them could not previously be quantified at this taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on mOTUs are more accurate compared to other methods. As a new feature, we show that mOTUs, which are based on essential housekeeping genes, are demonstrably well-suited for quantification of basal transcriptional activity of community members. Furthermore, single nucleotide variation profiles estimated using mOTUs reflect those from whole genomes, which allows for comparing microbial strain populations (e.g., across different human body sites).

Here we provide answer to such a question for any configuration of the terminal points x(1), x(2),..., x(N) in the two- and three-dimensional cases. Specifically, the existence of a web is guaranteed by a necessary and sufficient condition on the loading which corresponds to a finite dimensional linear programming problem. In two dimensions, we show that any such web can be replaced by one in which there are at most P elementary loops, where elementary means that the loop cannot be subdivided into subloops, and where P is the number of forces f(1), f(2),..., f(N) applied at points strictly within the convex hull of x(1), x(2),..., x(N). In three dimensions, we show that, by slightly perturbing f(1), f(2),..., f(N), there exists a uniloadable web supporting this loading. Uniloadable means it supports this loading and all positive multiples of it, but not any other loading. Uniloadable webs provide a mechanism for channelling stress in desired ways.

This method should allow both consumers and online music dealers to check the authenticity of lossless music files. This implementation focuses on the MPEG AAC codec, but the method can also be applied to an MP3 codec. It is based on the detection of quantization errors in the time-frequency domain without machine learning. The final results on a large database of 1576 audio files, original and transcoded with AAC from iTunes, show null false positive ratios and very low false negative ratios, possibly null for high-precision settings, which is better than other methods.

Iron is a key driver of plankton dynamics and, therefore, of global biogeochemical cycles and climate. To assess the impact of iron availability on plankton communities, we explored the comprehensive bio-oceanographic and bio-omics data sets from Tara Oceans in the context of the iron products from two state-of-the-art global scale biogeochemical models. We obtained novel information about adaptation and acclimation toward iron in a range of phytoplankton, including picocyanobacteria and diatoms, and identified whole subcommunities covarying with iron. Many of the observed global patterns were recapitulated in the Marquesas archipelago, where frequent plankton blooms are believed to be caused by natural iron fertilization, although they are not captured in large-scale biogeochemical models. This work provides a proof of concept that integrative analyses, spanning from genes to ecosystems and viruses to zooplankton, can disentangle the complexity of plankton communities and can lead to more accurate formulations of resource bioavailability in biogeochemical models, thus improving our understanding of plankton resilience in a changing environment. Plain Language Summary Marine phytoplankton require iron for their growth and proliferation. According to John Martin's iron hypothesis, fertilizing the ocean with iron could dramatically increase photosynthetic activity, thus representing a biological means to counteract global warming. However, while there is a constantly growing knowledge of how iron is distributed in the ocean and about its role in cellular processes in marine photosynthetic groups such as diatoms and cyanobacteria, less is known about how iron availability shapes plankton communities and how they respond to it. In the present work, we exploited recently published Tara Oceans data sets to address these questions. We first defined specific subcommunities of co-occurring organisms that co-vary with iron availability in the oceans. We then identified specific patterns of adaptation and acclimation to iron in different groups of phytoplankton. Finally, we validated our global results at local scale, specifically in the Marquesas archipelago, where recurrent phytoplankton blooms arc believed to be a result of iron fertilization. By integrating global data with a localized response, we provide a framework for understanding the resilience of plankton ecosystems in a changing environment.

While the underlying mechanisms remain widely debated, production was recently determined as the most probable cause of increases in fish biomass. Changes in fish biomass in a temperate AR system were investigated from December 2008 to November 2015 by considering seven distinct functional groups, and isotopic functional indices were used to identify how these changes may have affected organic matter (OM) fluxes. Contrasting patterns of change were observed between functional trophic groups, highlighting that combining the biomass of all species present in a community is inappropriate for assessing AR-induced effects. Benthic sedentary species pre-dominated (> 75% of the total biomass) through massive production, with a 68-fold increase in mean biomass over the study period. Mobile species tended to vary seasonally, suggesting only a slight influence of AR. Zooplanktivores biomass decreased over the 6-year period, as a possible result of changes in environmental conditions. Isotopic indices helped to reveal both the community maturation and the importance of local OM sources not only in supporting fish biomass production but also in attracting pelagic species. Our results corroborate that production and attraction are two extremes of a range of contrasting patterns and highlight the importance of considering the specific responses of functional components of fish communities to accurately describe changes in AR functioning. Functional attributes such as trophic traits, habitat use and dispersal abilities must not be overlooked as they modulate fish species responses to the deployment of man-made rocky substrates.

Physiological stress markers during breath-hold diving and SCUBA diving								PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS				7	6					e14033	10.14814/phy2.14033			MAR 2019	2019	This study investigated the sources of physiological stress in diving by comparing SCUBA dives (stressors: hydrostatic pressure, cold, and hyperoxia), apneic dives (hydrostatic pressure, cold, physical activity, hypoxia), and dry static apnea (hypoxia only). We hypothesized that despite the hypoxia induces by a long static apnea, it would be less stressful than SCUBA dive or apneic dives since the latter combined high pressure, physical activity, and cold exposure. Blood samples were collected from 12SCUBA and 12 apnea divers before and after dives. On a different occasion, samples were collected from the apneic group before and after a maximal static dry apnea. We measured changes in levels of the stress hormones cortisol and copeptin in each situation. To identify localized effects of the stress, we measured levels of the cardiac injury markers troponin (cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), the muscular stress markers myoglobin and lactate), and the hypoxemia marker ischemia-modified albumin (IMA). Copeptin, cortisol, and IMA levels increased for the apneic dive and the static dry apnea, whereas they decreased for the SCUBA dive. Troponin, BNP, and myoglobin levels increased for the apneic dive, but were unchanged for the SCUBA dive and the static dry apnea. We conclude that hypoxia induced by apnea is the dominant trigger for the release of stress hormones and cardiac injury markers, whereas cold or and hyperbaric exposures play a minor role. These results indicate that subjects should be screened carefully for pre-existing cardiac diseases before undertaking significant apneic maneuvers.

We first develop a feature representation technique that encodes high-order statistics of local features in two levels, where single Gaussians are used to capture the distributions involved. To deal with the possible loss of information about the distribution of features caused by heterogeneous feature vectors when summarizing them, we use K-means clustering and Sparse Coding to construct some sets of feature vectors over which the summarization is performed. We then present two methods based on depth images and pose data for action recognition. In both methods, the proposed feature representation technique is applied to effectively obtain discriminative action descriptors. Experimental evaluation on the seven benchmark datasets, i.e., MSRAction3D, MSRGesture3D, DHA, SKIG, Florence, UTKinect, and HDM05, shows that our methods achieve very promising results on all the datasets.

J	Paix, Benoit; Ezzedine, Jade A.; Jacquet, Stephan								Diversity, Dynamics, and Distribution of Bdellovibrio and Like Organisms in Perialpine Lakes								APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY				85	6					e02494-18	10.1128/AEM.02494-18			MAR 2019	2019	Microbes drive a variety of ecosystem processes and services, but many of them remain largely unexplored because of a lack of knowledge on both the diversity and functionality of some potentially crucial microbiological compartments. This is the case with and within the group of bacterial predators collectively known as Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs). Here, we report the abundance, distribution, and diversity of three families of these obligate predatory Gram-negative bacteria in three perialpine lakes (Lakes Annecy, Bourget, and Geneva). The study was conducted at different depths (near-surface versus 45 or 50 m) from August 2015 to January 2016. Using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and cloning-sequencing approaches, we show that the diversity of BALOs is relatively low and very specific to freshwaters or even the lakes themselves. While the Peredibacteraceae family was represented mainly by a single species (Peredibacter starrii), it could represent up to 7% of the total bacterial cell abundances. Comparatively, the abundances of the two other families (Bdellovibrionaceae and Bacteriovoracaceae) were significantly lower. In addition, the distributions in the water column were very different between the three groups, suggesting various life strategies/niches, as follows: Peredibacteraceae dominated near the surface, while Bdellovibrionaceae and Bacteriovoracaceae were more abundant at greater depths. Statistical analyses revealed that BALOs seem mainly to be driven by depth and temperature. Finally, this original study was also the opportunity to design new quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers for Peredibacteraceae quantification. IMPORTANCE This study highlights the abundance, distribution, and diversity of a poorly known microbial compartment in natural aquatic ecosystems, the Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs). These obligate bacterial predators of other bacteria may have an important functional role. This study shows the relative quantitative importance of the three main families of this group, with the design of a new primer pair, and their diversity. While both the diversity and the abundances of these BALOs were globally low, it is noteworthy that the abundance of the Peredibacteraceae could reach important values.

Controlling dislocation nucleation-mediated plasticity in nanostructures via surface modification								ACTA MATERIALIA				166				572	586		10.1016/j.actamat.2018.12.048			MAR 2019	2019	A straightforward strategy for reaching the ultimate strength of crystalline metals is to synthesize materials with a scarcity of defects. Bottom-up synthesis of nanostructures is an ideal means of approaching this limit, where nucleation of dislocations is a requirement in otherwise perfect crystals to facilitate plastic flow and mitigate brittle fracture. In this deformation mechanism regime where thermal fluctuations assist in the nucleation process, surface self-diffusion emerges as the rate-limiting step needed to promote displacive activity. We conducted tensile experiments in situ on pristine Au nanowires in addition to nanowires with thin Al2O3 coatings produced by atomic layer deposition. Distributions of yield strengths of nanowires with fully conformal coatings show a pronounced reduction in scatter and a measurable shift toward higher values. The presence of coatings did not curtail the ability of the nanowires to sustain significant amounts of plastic strain. In all conditions, nucleation of partial dislocations governed incipient plasticity. Analyses of the data using a thermal activation model in tandem with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction point to the potent effect of control over the near surface zone in mediating diffusion, and thereby dislocation nucleation and the ensuing plastic response of the nanostructures.

The interchanging appearance of two twins could be revisited by our calculations. The probabilities used correspond to those which were analytically derived for an undercooling of Delta T = 0.6 K (Lin and Lan, 2017).

The complexity of the equilibrium phase diagram is described in some details. The first order transition W reversible arrow W' is specified on the iron/wustite boundary near 1185 K. Transitions correlated to the modifications Wi at T(W) > 1185K and W'j at T(W') < 1185K (i and j = 1,2,3) are re-examined. Structural determinations based on the characterization of point defects stabilization and of their clustering are reviewed. Additionally, the pseudo-phases are examined based on the transformation of defect clusters or of their mode of distribution (i.e., percolation or superstructure) with the inclusion of changes in electronic charge carriers.

Marine coastal environments are among the most urbanized areas and as a consequence experience environmental pressures. The highly anthropized Toulon Bay (France) was considered as a model system to investigate shifts in bacterioplankton communities along natural and anthropogenic physicochemical gradients during a 1-month survey. In depth geochemical characterization mainly revealed strong and progressive Cd, Zn, Cu, and Pb contamination gradients between the entrance of the Bay and the north-western anthropized area. On the other hand, low-amplitude natural gradients were observed for other environmental variables. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed strong spatial patterns in bacterioplankton taxonomic and predicted function structure along the chemical contamination gradient. Variation partitioning analysis demonstrated that multiple metallic contamination explained the largest part of the spatial biological variations observed, but DOC and salinity were also significant contributors. Network analysis revealed that biotic interactions were far more numerous than direct interactions between microbial groups and environmental variables. This suggests indirect effects of the environment, and especially trace metals, on the community through a few taxonomic groups. These spatial patterns were also partially found for predicted bacterioplankton functions, thus indicating a limited functional redundancy. All these results highlight both potential direct influences of trace metals contamination on coastal bacterioplankton and indirect forcing through biotic interactions and cascading.

Dendrite orientation transition in Al-Ge alloys								ACTA MATERIALIA				165				666	677		10.1016/j.actamat.2018.12.001			FEB 15 2019	2019	We report on a dendrite orientation transition (DOT) discovered in the Al-Ge system by conducting isothermal solidification experiments in thin samples under slow cooling conditions. The DOT was revealed using a combination of in situ X-radiography imaging and post-mortem electron backscatter diffraction. In Al-20 wt% Ge the primary arms grow along (100), whereas in Al-46 wt% Ge the primary arms grow along < 110 >. At an intermediate composition of Al-29 wt% Ge, we observe both directions growing simultaneously. Phase-field simulations in which the solid-liquid interfacial energy anisotropy was systematically varied to correspond with the composition changes reproduced the experimentally observed microstructures. The remarkable agreement between the experimental observations and the simulations provides strong evidence that the DOT in this alloy system is caused by modification of surface energy anisotropy with increasing Ge content. Furthermore, we show that the confinement due to the thin sample geometry influences the selection of the primary growth directions, so that different growth morphologies develop depending on the orientation of the crystal in the sample.

Large-Size Single-Crystal Oligothiophene-Based Monolayers for Field-Effect Transistors								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				11	6			6315	6324		10.1021/acsami.8b20700			FEB 13 2019	2019	High structural quality of crystalline organic semiconductors is the basis of their superior electrical performance. Recent progress in quasi two-dimensional (2D) organic semiconductor films challenges bulk single crystals because both demonstrate competing charge-carrier mobilities. As the thinnest molecular semiconductors, monolayers offer numerous advantages such as unmatched flexibility and light transparency as well they are an excellent platform for sensing. Oligothiophene-based materials are among the most promising ones for light-emitting applications because of the combination of efficient luminescence and decent charge-carrier mobility. Here, we demonstrate single-crystal monolayers of unprecedented structural order grown from four alkyl-substituted thiophene and thiophene phenylene oligomers. The monolayer crystals with lateral dimensions up to 3 mm were grown from the solution on substrates with various surface energies and roughness by drop or spin-casting with subsequent slow solvent evaporation. Our data indicate that 2D crystallization resulting in single-crystal monolayers occurs at the receding gas-solution substrate contact line. The structural properties of the monolayers were studied by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction/reflectivity, atomic force and differential interference contrast microscopies, and imaging spectroscopic ellipsometry. These highly ordered monolayers demonstrated an excellent performance in organic field-effect transistors approaching the best values reported for the thiophene or thiophene phenylene oligomers. Our findings pave the way for efficient monolayer organic electronics highlighting the high potential of simple solution-processing techniques for the growth of large-size single-crystal monolayers with excellent structural order and electrical performance competing against bulk single crystals.

We perform these measurements at four different redshifts and within four different cosmological scenarios, covering a wide range in neutrino masses. We find that the nonlinear correction to the velocity power spectra largely depends on the degree of nonlinear evolution with no specific dependence on the value of neutrino mass. We provide a fitting formula based on the value of the rms of the matter fluctuations in spheres of 8 h(-1) Mpc, describing the nonlinear corrections with 3% accuracy on scales below k = 0.7 h Mpc(-1).

This study investigates spatial and temporal changes of the suspended particulate matter (SPM) content in the North-Eastern part of Japan (Pacific Ocean) using a geostationary ocean color sensor. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), which is centered on the Korean peninsula but could also observe the Japanese area, is able to acquire eight images per day, thus allowing the analysis of rapid daily changes in water mass. The analysis of GOCI data shows that SPM concentration notably increased both along the coast and within the Bay of Sendai shortly after the tsunami. Motionless patterns of SPM were observed at 2, 14, 25, and 37 km from the coast. It is shown that SPM concentration rapidly decreased one month later. The SPM concentration did not remain high the following year, contrary to what was observed for the Sumatra Tsunami in 2004. The origin of SPM is also investigated in this study. Our analysis suggests that some of the SPM originates from the resuspension of bottom sediments due to the reflection of the tsunami on the coastline that leads to the migration of marine particles toward the sea surface. The fate of the SPM concentration is then discussed based on the analysis of meteorological conditions, river discharge, and tsunami wave properties.

Despite this important application, the phase diagram of the Ag-Cd-In ternary system remains largely unknown especially the phase equilibria involving the liquid phase in the Cd- and In-rich regions. In this work, the 60at.% In isopleth section is investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA). The results of the classical protocol at constant heating and cooling rates are compared with those obtained using an interrupted heating DTA (IHDTA) method. It is shown that this last protocol allows to strongly reduce the uncertainty on the liquidus temperature determination.

Among them are nutrition-related health conditions, which can significantly decrease the quality of life. We envision a system that monitors the kitchen activities of patients and that based on the detected eating behaviour could provide clinicians with indicators for improving a patient's health. To be successful, such system has to reason about the person's actions and goals. To address this problem, we introduce a symbolic behaviour recognition approach, called Computational Causal Behaviour Models (CCBM). CCBM combines symbolic representation of person's behaviour with probabilistic inference to reason about one's actions, the type of meal being prepared, and its potential health impact. To evaluate the approach, we use a cooking dataset of unscripted kitchen activities, which contains data from various sensors in a real kitchen. The results show that the approach is able to reason about the person's cooking actions. It is also able to recognise the goal in terms of type of prepared meal and whether it is healthy. Furthermore, we compare CCBM to state-of-the-art approaches such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and decision trees (DT). The results show that our approach performs comparable to the HMM and DT when used for activity recognition. It outperformed the HMM for goal recognition of the type of meal with median accuracy of 1 compared to median accuracy of 0.12 when applying the HMM. Our approach also outperformed the HMM for recognising whether a meal is healthy with a median accuracy of 1 compared to median accuracy of 0.5 with the HMM.

The InGaAs/GaAsSb staggered band-offset heterojunction is expected to improve tunneling properties. Devices have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy with various thicknesses and/or Sb and In concentrations. For thin elastically strained type-II tunnel junctions, the electrical characteristics exhibit degraded transport performances compared to the reference p+ GaAs/n+ GaAs tunnel junction structures, while much better tunneling peak currents are achieved with strain-relaxed thick type-II tunnel junctions. Based on a theoretical analysis of the local density of states and the band-edges profiles of the type-II tunnel junctions, we propose a suitable design for type-II tunnel junctions with high tunneling current density toward their use in multi-junction solar cells.

Contrary to commonly used biocide-based antifouling coatings, they do not release biocides into the marine environment, however, they suffer from poor antifouling efficacy during idle periods. To improve their antifouling performances in static conditions, various amounts of hydrolyzable polymers were incorporated within a silicone matrix. These hydrolyzable polymers were chosen for the well-known hydrolytic degradation mechanism of their main chain, e.g. poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), or of their ester pending groups, e.g. poly(bis(trimethylsilyloxy)methylsilyl methacrylate) (PMATM2). The degradation kinetics of such hydrolyzable silicone coatings were assessed by mass loss measurements during immersion in deionized water. Coatings containing PMATM2 exhibited a maximum mass loss after 12 weeks, whereas PCL-based coatings showed no significant mass loss after 24 weeks. Dynamic contact angle measurements revealed the modifications of the coatings surface chemistry with an amphiphilic behavior after water exposure. The attachment of macrofoulers on these coatings were evaluated by field tests in the Mediterranean Sea, demonstrating the short or long-term antifouling effect of these hydrolyzable polymers embedded in the silicone matrix. The settlement of A. amphitrite barnacles on the different coatings indicated inhospitable behaviors towards larval barnacles for coatings with at least 15 wt % of additives.

There have been claims that relational quantum mechanics is local, but it is not clear then how it accounts for the effects that go under the usual name of quantum non-locality. The present article shows that the failure of "locality' in the sense of Bell, once interpreted in the relational framework, reduces to the existence of a common cause in an indeterministic context.

We investigated the antifouling potential of unexplored benthic tropical microalgae using anti-adhesion and toxicity bioassays against two major micro- and ma crobiofoulers, namely bacteria and barnacles. Fifty strains belonging to six phyla [Cyanobacteria, Miozoa (Dinoflagellata), Bacillariophyta, Cryptophyta, Rhodophyta and Haptophyta] were isolated from southwestern Islands of the Indian Ocean. They were chosen in order to represent as much as possible the huge biodiversity of such a rich tropical ecosystem. The associated chemodiversity was highlighted by both NMR- and LC-MS-based metabolomics. The screening of 84 algal fractions revealed that the anti-adhesion activity was concentrated in methanolic ones (i.e. 93% of all active fractions). Our results confirmed that microalgae constitute a promising source of natural antimicrofoulants as 17 out of the 30 active fractions showed high or very high capacity to inhibit the adhesion of three biofilm-forming marine bacteria. Dinoflagellate-derived fractions were the most active, both in terms of number and intensity. However, dinoflagellates were also more toxic and may not be suitable as a source of environmentally friendly antifouling compounds, in contrast to diatoms, e.g. Navicula mollis. The latter and two dinoflagellates of the genus Amphidinium also had interesting anti-settlement activities while being moderately toxic to barnacle larvae. Our approach, combining the bioprospecting of a large number of tropical microalgae for their anti-settlement potential and metabolomics analyses, constituted a first step towards the discovery of alternative ecofriendly antifoulants.

For bounded perturbations, we give sufficient ultraviolet regularity conditions on the perturbation for the moments of the heat variation to be uniformly bounded in time, and for the Fourier transform of the heat variation distribution to be analytic and uniformly bounded in time in a complex neighborhood of 0. On a set of canonical examples, with bounded and unbounded perturbations, we show that our ultraviolet conditions are essentially necessary. If the form factor of the perturbation does not meet our assumptions, the heat variation distribution exhibits heavy tails. The tails can be as heavy as preventing the existence of a fourth moment of the heat variation.

Using fluorescence and bioluminescence sensors to characterize auto- and heterotrophic plankton communities								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				171				76	92		10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.010			FEB 2019	2019	High-resolution autonomous sensors routinely measure physical (temperature, salinity), chemical (oxygen, nutrients) and biological (fluorescence) parameters. However, while fluorescence provides a proxy for phytoplankton, heterotrophic populations remain challenging to monitor in real-time and at high resolution. Bathyphotometers, sensors which measure the light emitted by bioluminescent organisms when mechanically stimulated, provide the capability to identify bioluminescent dinoflagellates and zooplankton. In the coastal ocean, highly abundant dinoflagellates emitting low-intensity flashes generate a background bioluminescence signal, while rarer zooplankton emit bright flashes that can be individually resolved by high-frequency sensors. Bathyphotometers were deployed from ships and onboard autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) during three field campaigns in Monterey Bay, California. Ship-based in situ water samples were simultaneously collected and the plankton communities characterized. Plankton concentrations were matched with concurrent datasets of fluorescence and bioluminescence to develop proxies for autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, other phytoplankton such as diatoms, copepods, larvaceans (appendicularians), and small jellies. The method extracts the bioluminescence background as a proxy for dinoflagellates, and exploits differences in bioluminescence flash intensity between several types of zooplankton to identify larvaceans, copepods and small jellies. Fluorescence is used to discriminate between autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, and to identify other autotrophic plankton. Concurrent fluorometers and bathyphotometers onboard AUVs can thus provide a novel view of plankton diversity and phytoplankton/zooplankton interactions in the sea.

Most of the previous works focus on solving the problem of influence maximization, which aims to identify a small subset of early adopters in a social network to maximize the influence propagation under a given diffusion model. On the contrary in this paper, motivated by real-world scenarios, we propose two different influence minimization problems. We consider a linear threshold diffusion model and provide a general solution to the first problem by solving an integer linear programming problem. For the second problem, we provide a technique to search for an optimal solution that works only in particular cases and discuss a simple heuristic to find a solution in the general case.

J	Lima, Rinaldo; Espinasse, Bernard; Freitas, Fred								A logic-based relational learning approach to relation extraction: The OntoILPER system								ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE				78				142	157		10.1016/j.engappai.2018.11.001			FEB 2019	2019	Relation Extraction (RE), the task of detecting and characterizing semantic relations between entities in text, has gained much importance in the last two decades, mainly in the biomedical domain. Many papers have been published on Relation Extraction using supervised machine learning techniques. Most of these techniques rely on statistical methods, such as feature-based and tree-kernels-based methods. Such statistical learning techniques are usually based on a propositional hypothesis space for representing examples, i.e., they employ an attribute-value representation of features. This kind of representation has some drawbacks, particularly in the extraction of complex relations which demand more contextual information about the involving instances, i.e., it is not able to effectively capture structural information from parse trees without loss of information. In this work, we present OntoILPER, a logic-based relational learning approach to Relation Extraction that uses Inductive Logic Programming for generating extraction models in the form of symbolic extraction rules. OntoILPER takes profit of a rich relational representation of examples, which can alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks. The proposed relational approach seems to be more suitable for Relation Extraction than statistical ones for several reasons that we argue. Moreover, OntoILPER uses a domain ontology that guides the background knowledge generation process and is used for storing the extracted relation instances. The induced extraction rules were evaluated on three protein-protein interaction datasets from the biomedical domain. The performance of OntoILPER extraction models was compared with other state-of-the-art RE systems. The encouraging results seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

We derive error estimates for this scheme on two and three dimensional Cartesian grids. Error estimates are obtained by using the discrete version of the relative energy method introduced on the continuous level in Feireisl et al. (J Math Fluid Mech 14(4):717-730, 2012). A systematic use of the theoretical continuous analysis of the equations in combination with the numerical tools is crucial for the result. This error estimate does not uses stability hypotheses on the solution of the numerical scheme.

In the Atlantic and Indian oceans, purse-seine nets are sometimes set around tuna schools associated with whale sharks and baleen whales, although less frequently than around free-swimming tuna schools or those associated with fish aggregating devices (FAD). However, knowledge on the targeted catch and bycatch in these megafauna associated fishing sets is still relatively limited. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess species and size composition of the target tuna species, as well as the diversity of bycatch species in whale and whale shark associated sets. Whale associated sets were found to be very similar to free school sets in terms of tuna catch (large yellowfin tuna), bycatch occurrence (presence in half the sets) and species assemblage (alpha and beta diversity). Whale shark associated sets were intermediate between FAD and free school sets, with tuna catch (skipjack and juvenile yellowfin) closer to FAD than to free school sets. However, the presence of large yellowfin, the bycatch composition (with almost no finfish, abundantly captured in FAD sets) and the species assemblage showed similarity with free school sets. This study highlights the need for an EAFM in the tuna purse-seine fishery by providing knowledge on pelagic multi-specific catches and bycatches.

This tool generates 2D as well as 3D mull-fiber microstructure geometries for unidirectional composites with random distributions. Its originality resides on the fact of taking into account the interphase region between each fiber and the matrix. Instructions for users on how to install and execute the plug-in are presented. Several images of the graphical user's interface are showed in order to introduce the features of the tool. Finally, an example using a geometry generated by the plug-in with an experimentally based finite dimension for the interphase, is provided and includes a numerical/experimental macroscale comparison for validation. This plug-in represents an aid to the conception by helping ABAQUS (TM) users to save time in an early stage of the analysis which is the geometry generation. Further improvements are suggested to extend the capabilities of the tool.

Skin alcohol perspiration measurements using MOX sensors								SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL				280				306	312		10.1016/j.snb.2018.09.082			FEB 1 2019	2019	The aim of this study is to develop the first system based on chemical MOX sensors for monitoring ethanol on the skin after consumption. Thus, non-invasive measurements to monitor alcohol concentration and their correlation with blood and breathe Alcohol become possible. Transdermal alcohol emissions by perspiration have been investigated during clinical trials to demonstrate the relevance of this method. First, three commercial MOX sensors were used after calibration in respect of the thermodynamic conditions of the skin surface. Then, six volunteers have been selected for clinical trials with two cohorts of BAC target: 0.5 g/l and 0.8 g/l, and the three different sensors have been integrated in a wristband. We observed that the skin emits ethanol concentrations and we found a consistent correspondence between the kinetics of blood, breath and perspiration. MOX sensors can reliably estimate whether a drinker consumed a low or significant amount of alcohol. After validating this method, we developed our sensors based on tin dioxide thin sensitive layers with thickness of 50 nm. Sensitive properties of the films to ethanol were studied in the conditions of the skin surface. The sensor shows a higher response to ethanol (r = 7.8 for 50 ppm) with relative humidity of 50% and a lower consumption (55 mW) than commercial sensors (MICS 5524: 65 mW).

Accordingly, multiple players have been proposed to participate in the Fe-S delivery step to apo-target proteins, but critical gaps exist in the knowledge of Fe-S proteins biogenesis in anaerobic organisms. Mrp/NBP35 ATP-binding proteins are a subclass of the soluble P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase superfamily (P-loop NTPase) known to bind and transfer Fe-S clusters in vitro. Here, we report investigations of a novel atypical two-domain Mrp/NBP35 ATP-binding protein named Mrp(ORP) associating a P-loop NTPase domain with a dinitrogenase iron-molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis domain (Di-Nase). Characterization of full length MrpORP, as well as of its two domains, showed that both domains bind Fe-S clusters. We provide in vitro evidence that the P-loop NTPase domain of the Mrp(ORP) can efficiently transfer its Fe-S cluster to apo-target proteins of the ORange Protein (ORP) complex, suggesting that this novel protein is involved in the maturation of these Fe-S proteins. Last, we showed for the first time, by fluorescence microscopy imaging a polar localization of a Mrp/NBP35 protein.

J	Panagiotopoulos, Christos; Pujo-Pay, Mireille; Benavides, Mar; Van Wambeke, France; Sempere, Richard								The composition and distribution of semi-labile dissolved organic matter across the southwest Pacific								BIOGEOSCIENCES				16	1			105	116		10.5194/bg-16-105-2019			JAN 15 2019	2019	The distribution and dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved combined neutral sugars (DCNS) were studied across an increasing oligotrophic gradient (18 to 22 degrees S latitude) in the tropical South Pacific Ocean, spanning from the Melanesian Archipelago (MA) area to the western part of the South Pacific gyre (WGY), in austral summer as a part of the OUTPACE project. Our results show that DOC and DCNS concentrations exhibited no statistical differences between the MA and WGY areas (0-200 m: 47-81 mu MC for DOC and 0.2-4.2 mu MC for DCNS). However, due to a deepening of the euphotic zone, a deeper penetration of DOC was noticeable at 150 m of depth at the WGY area. Excess DOC (DOCEX) was determined as the difference between surface and deep-sea DOC values, and euphotic zone integrated stocks of both DOC and DOCEX were higher in the WGY than the MA area. Considering DOCEX as representative of semi-labile DOC (DOCSL), its residence time was calculated as the ratio of DOCSL to bacterial carbon demand (BCD). This residence time was 176 +/- 43 days (n = 3) in the WGY area, about 3 times longer than in the MA area (T-r = 51 +/- 13 days, n = 8), suggesting an accumulation of semi-labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the surface waters of WGY. Average epipelagic (0-200 m) DCNS yields (DCNS x DOC-1) based on volumetric data were roughly similar in both areas, accounting for similar to 2.8 % of DOC. DCNS exhibited a longer residence time in WGY (T-r = 91 +/- 41 days, n = 3) than in MA (T-r = 31 +/- 10 days, n = 8), further suggesting that this DCNS pool persists longer in the surface waters of the WGY. The accumulation of DOCEX in the surface waters of WGY is probably due to very slow bacterial degradation due to nutrient and/or energy limitation of heterotrophic prokaryotes, indicating that biologically produced DOC can be stored in the euphotic layer of the South Pacific gyre for a long period.

The answer is positive, though nonuniversal, since the fluctuations depend on the underlying geometry. We consider in detail two examples of 2D systems for which imposed external constraints force the underlying stationary stochastic process to stay in an atypical regime with anomalous statistics. The first example deals with the fluctuations of a stretched 2D random walk above a semicircle or a triangle. In the second example we consider a 2D biased random walk along a channel with forbidden voids of circular and triangular shapes. In both cases we are interested in the dependence of a typical span < d(t)> similar to t(gamma) of the trajectory of t steps above the top of the semicircle or the triangle. We show that gamma = 1/3, i.e., < d(t)> shares the KPZ statistics for the semicircle, while gamma = 0 for the triangle. We propose heuristic derivations of scaling exponents gamma for different geometries, justify them by explicit analytic computations, and compare with numeric simulations. For practical purposes, our results demonstrate that the geometry of voids in a channel might have a crucial impact on the width of the boundary layer and, thus, on the heat transfer in the channel.

When the system has enough time and spatial symmetries, a Hamiltonian of a test particle is completely integrable and can be reduced to a single degree of freedom Hamiltonian for each initial state. The reduced Hamiltonian sometimes has unstable fixed points (saddle points) and associated separatrices. To choose among available dynamically compatible equilibrium states of the one particle density function of these systems we use a maximum entropy principle and discuss how the unstable fixed points affect the density profile or a local pressure gradient, and are able to create a steep profile that improves plasma confinement.

The tests show that LTROs tested as a dummy have a favorable impact. However, till December 2011, the impact of the amount of LTROs was insignificant or negative. This suggests that full allotment liquidity measures, disclosing interbank markets liquidity needs, could generate adverse collateral effect disturbing the unconventional monetary policies transmission channels, in particular the signaling channel. Moreover, the effectiveness of the signaling channel of liquidity measures would rely on their use as the sole monetary policy tool carrying all the information about the policy stance, while the ECB, whose mandate usually focuses price stability, has twice raised twice its policy rate in 2011.

Such a system is defined by a tuple B = (p, n, gamma, rho, E) where E is an element of Z[X] and E(gamma) = 0 (mod p). In a PMNS, an element a of Z/pZ is represented by a polynomial A such that: A(gamma) = a (mod p), deg A < n and parallel to A parallel to(infinity) < rho. In [6], the authors mentioned that PMNS can be highly redundant but they didn't really take advantage of this possibility. In this paper we use, for the first time, the redundancy of PMNS to protect algorithms against Side Channel Attacks (SCA). More precisely, we focus on elliptic curve cryptography. We show how to randomize the modular multiplication in order to be safe against existing SCA and we demonstrate the resistance of our construction. We describe the generation of a PMNS while guaranteeing, for all elements of Z/pZ, the minimum number of distinct representations we want. We also show how to reach all these representations.

In earlier papers, we defined a highly expressive ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) model for regulating MQTT-based IoT communications. Our model allows us to express various types of contextual security rules, (temporal security rules, content-based security rules, rules based on the frequency of events etc.). These rules regulate not only publications and subscriptions but also distribution of messages to subscribers. In this paper we present an access control enforcement system based on our model. Our system is built according to the XACML architecture standard. The Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is written in Python and acts as a proxy between the nodes and the MQTT broker. It intercepts MQTT requests and transfer them to the Policy Decision Point (PDP). RDF and SHACL are used to represent security rules and more generally any knowledge contained in the Policy Information System (PIP). We conduct some experiments that show that our solution is viable in terms of performances.

As an example, a location name A used by a process p and a location name B not equal A used by another process q can correspond to the very same memory location X, and similarly for the names B used by p and A used by q which may (or may not) correspond to the same memory location Y not equal X. In this context, the PODC paper presented a 2-process symmetric deadlock-free mutual exclusion (mutex) algorithm and a necessary condition on the sizem of the anonymous memory for the existence of such an n-process algorithm. This condition states thatm must be belongs to M(n) \ {1} where M(n) = {m :. l for all 1 < l <= n : gcd( l, m) = 1}. Symmetric means here that, process identities define a specific data type which allows a process to check only if two identities are equal or not. The present paper presents two optimal deadlock-free symmetric mutual exclusion algorithms for n-process systems where communication is throughm registers. The first algorithm, which considers anonymous read/write registers, works for any m which is >= n and belongs to the set M(n). It follows that this condition on m is both necessary and sufficient for symmetric deadlock-free mutual exclusion in this anonymity context, and this algorithm is optimal with respect to m. The second algorithm, which considers anonymous read/modify/write atomic registers, works for any m is an element of M(n), which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for anonymous read/modify/write registers. It follows that, when m > 1, m is an element of M(n) is a tight characterization of the size of the anonymous shared memory needed to solve deadlock-free mutex, be the registers read/write or read/modify/write.

A new multiview and multimodal human movement dataset is also introduced part of which is used to evaluate the results of the proposed method. We present comparative experimental results on pose estimation using a manifold-based pose representation built from motion-captured data. We show that the new RGB derived features provide pose estimates of similar or better accuracy than those produced from depth data, even from single views only.

They are considered as a fundamental part of any production facility and their efficiencies are certainly influencing the final products' quality. Therefore, the increase in process equipment and automation degree have raised, as a consequence, the number of configured alarms to monitor the processes, which, during the operation, results in floods of alarms that decreased the effectiveness of alarm system and increased operator workloads beyond their capacities. The identification of critical and relevant alarms to products quality helps in monitoring simultaneously alarm performance and their impact on the final product. This paper presents an approach based on the AdaBoost algorithm for addressing alarm issues by predicting their risk of final product degradation as a function of their statistical behaviors of activation on product lots during production operation which in turns has used to group alarms. The results show a good performance of this method which has demonstrated on a real dataset collected from a semiconductor fabrication facility.

Complete methods for this problem include Branch and Bound (BnB) algorithms which use max-resolution, the inference rule for Max-SAT, to ensure that every computed Inconsistent Subset (IS) is counted only once in the lower bound estimation. However, learning max-resolution transformations can be detrimental to their performance so they are usually selectively learned if they respect certain patterns. In this paper, we focus on recently introduced patterns called Unit Clause Subsets (UCSs). We characterize the transformations of certain UCS patterns using the UP-resilience property. Finally, we explain how our result can help extend the current patterns.

First, a 3-dimensional Gaussian kernel is used to form smoothed sequences that allow to deal with well-known limitations of local encoding such as near uniform regions and sensitivity to noise. Second, a receptive volume of the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) is figured out to mitigate the negative impacts of environmental and illumination changes which are major challenges in DT understanding. Finally, a local encoding operator is addressed to construct a discriminative descriptor of enhancing patterns extracted from the filtered volumes. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (i.e., UCLA, DynTex, and DynTex++) for issue of DT classification have positively validated our crucial contributions.

In this work, we investigate a learning-capable architecture, based on the concept of Binarized Neural Networks, which addresses these three issues. It exploits the analog properties of the weak RESET in hafnium-oxide RRAM cells, but uses exclusively compact and low power digital CMOS. This approach requires no refresh process, is more robust to device imperfections than more conventional analog approaches, and we show that due to the reliance on weak RESETs, the devices show outstanding endurance that can withstand multiple learning processes.

This method allowed us the continuous monitoring of alcohol in a non-invasive way with low cost and easy fabrication process. From the calibration results, the fabricated sensors exhibited high sensitivity, with fast detection and good stability, toward a wide range of ethanol concentrations. Additionally, they showed high immunity to elevate relative humidity percentages. Real time transdermal alcohol monitoring was performed on a volunteer. Twenty minutes after drinking 50 ml of tequila, the skin starts to emit alcohol and the sensor resistance begins to decrease. Alongside to this, breath alcohol measurements were simultaneously collected by using DRAGGER 6820 certified breathalyzer. The results revealed a consistent correspondence between the kinetics of blood, breath and perspiration, which validate the developed device reported in this work.

J	Chen, Mickael; Artieres, Thierry; Denoyer, Ludovic								Unsupervised Object Segmentation by Redrawing								Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems				32										2019	2019	Object segmentation is a crucial problem that is usually solved by using supervised learning approaches over very large datasets composed of both images and corresponding object masks. Since the masks have to be provided at pixel level, building such a dataset for any new domain can be very time-consuming. We present ReDO, a new model able to extract objects from images without any annotation in an unsupervised way. It relies on the idea that it should be possible to change the textures or colors of the objects without changing the overall distribution of the dataset. Following this assumption, our approach is based on an adversarial architecture where the generator is guided by an input sample: given an image, it extracts the object mask, then redraws a new object at the same location. The generator is controlled by a discriminator that ensures that the distribution of generated images is aligned to the original one. We experiment with this method on different datasets and demonstrate the good quality of extracted masks.

This historical myth illustrates the progress of civilization over nature, and, at the twilight of the XIXth century, the end of a long epic warfare and the closure of the vast Indian open spaces in North America. Then comes the period of denial, or at least the general idea that this affair belongs to the past, as if history were not grounded in time past which only gives a tragic dimension to the present awareness. To hide this conscious oblivion, everything has been planned in order to turn history into archeoogy, in the perspective of a recent nation delimiting Indian reserves and building museums used as an official sanctuary for the Indian people inheritage and art. Therefore the question is here to give the right place to this community, beyond the mere status of minority, to avoid the effects of a scheduled genocid through a new model of intellectual colonization in our approach of the wide-open spaces in North America.

First, Gaussian smoothing filter is used to deal with near uniform regions and noise which are typical restrictions of LBP operator. Second, the receptive field of Difference of Gaussians (DoG), which is exploited in DT description for the first time, allows to make the descriptor more robust against the changes of environment, illumination, and scale which are main challenges in DT representation. Experimental results of DT recognition on different benchmark datasets (i.e., UCLA, DynTex, and DynTex++), which give outstanding performance compared to the state of the art, verify the interest of our proposal.

J	Savary, Agata; Cordeiro, Silvio Ricardo; Ramisch, Carlos			Associ Computat Linguist					Without lexicons, multiword expression identification will never fly: A position statement								JOINT WORKSHOP ON MULTIWORD EXPRESSIONS AND WORDNET (MWE-WN 2019)								79	91					2019	2019	Because most multiword expressions (MWEs), especially verbal ones, are semantically non-compositional, their automatic identification in running text is a prerequisite for semantically-oriented downstream applications. However, recent developments, driven notably by the PARSEME shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs, show that this task is harder than related tasks, despite recent contributions both in multilingual corpus annotation and in computational models. In this paper, we analyse possible reasons for this state of affairs. They lie in the nature of the MWE phenomenon, as well as in its distributional properties. We also offer a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art systems, which exhibit particularly strong sensitivity to unseen data. On this basis, we claim that, in order to make strong headway in MWE identification, the community should bend its mind into coupling identification of MWEs with their discovery, via syntactic MWE lexicons. Such lexicons need not necessarily achieve a linguistically complete modelling of MWEs' behavior, but they should provide minimal morphosyntactic information to cover some potential uses, so as to complement existing MWE-annotated corpora. We define requirements for such a minimal NLP-oriented lexicon, and we propose a roadmap for the MWE community driven by these requirements.

Many of those are based on recent NLP advances, using neural sequence models that take continuous word representations as input. We study two related questions in neural verbal MWE identification: (a) the use of lemmas and/or surface forms as input features, and (b) the use of word-based or character-based embeddings to represent them. Our experiments on Basque, French, and Polish show that character-based representations yield systematically better results than word-based ones. In some cases, character-based representations of surface forms can be used as a proxy for lemmas, depending on the morphological complexity of the language.

We here proceed much further, by first analytically showing that this model can be seen as a specific member of the general class of mixing models involving spectral variability. Therefore, we then process such data with the IP-NMF and UP-NMF blind unmixing methods that we recently proposed in other works to handle spectral variability. Such a variability especially occurs when sea depth significantly varies over the considered scene, and we show that IP-NMF and UP-NMF then yield significantly better pure spectra estimation than a classical method from the literature which was not designed to handle such a variability.

The two-dimensional tests are performed for the case of flow over a low isolated hill. The simulations on computational domains with three different heights are discussed to evaluate the performance of the new far-field artificial boundary condition. The model is based on Boussinesq approximation of non-homogeneous Navier-Stokes equations, solved using artificial compressibility method, looking for a steady solution.

Our goal is to show how these social traces (signals) can play a vital role in improving Arabic and English Facebook search. Firstly, we identify polarities (positive or negative) carried by the textual signals (e.g. comments) and non-textual ones (e.g. the reactions love and sad) for a given Facebook posts. Therefore, the polarity of each comment expressed in Arabic or in English on a given Facebook post, is estimated on the basis of a neural sentiment model. Secondly, we group signals according to their complementarity using attributes (features) selection algorithms. Thirdly, we apply learning to rank (LTR) algorithms to re-rank Facebook search results based on the selected groups of signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on 13,500 Facebook posts, collected from 45 topics, for each of the two languages. Experiments results reveal that Random Forests was the most effective LTR approach for this task, and for the both languages. However, the best appropriate features selection algorithms are ReliefFAttributeEval and InfoGainAttributeEval for Arabic and English Facebook search task, respectively.

These nanocavities can support gap plasmons that make such devices suitable for light absorbing applications, both narrow or broadband depending on the size dispersion of the colloidal nanocubes that are used. Recently, a fabrication approach has been proposed that relies on an alkyldithiol self-assembled monolayer as a cavity spacer instead of the dielectric coating that is usually being used. Through this process it has been demonstrated both an enhanced reproducibility of the cavity resonance and a thinning of the cavity below the usual 3 nm limit. These caracteristics make such structures good candidates for nonlocality study because of the high electric field confinement that arises in very narrow gaps. This self assembled monolayer spacer is also an opportunity for incorporating electronic properties within the nanogap. In this perspective, the present work proposes both a synthesis and a two steps self-assembly of a clicked molecular rectifier monolayer to be embedded into nanopatch cavities. This way, this monolayer will act both as a mechanical spacer and a molecular diode, thus combining photonic and electronic properties.

Base revision in classical logic is done by the removal of formulas. Exploiting the non-monotonicity of ASP allows one to propose other revision strategies, namely addition strategy or removal and/or addition strategy. These strategies allow one to define families of rule-based revision operators. The paper presents a semantic characterization of these families of revision operators in terms of answer sets. This semantic characterization allows for equivalently considering the evolution of syntactic logic programs and the evolution of their semantic content. It then studies the logical properties of the proposed operators and gives complexity results.

Using an IV estimate and the GMM system estimator from Blundel and Bond (1998), the results show that an increase of gender equality index at primary-secondary and tertiary levels increases GDP per capita. Like the estimates using the gender equality index, a decrease of gender inequalities in education completion according to age groups has a beneficial effect on GDP per capita of the sample countries. As a result, CEMAC countries need to implement policies that reduce gender inequalities in education for sustainable economic growth. Also, an indirect negative impact of political instability, oil shocks and adolescent fertility on GDP is established.

In this paper, we address one of the most important aspects related to the reactivity of RMSs. We consider the relations, which link the conceived system with two important environments: its logical environment, i.e., the product family in which the RMS can evolve, and its physical environment, i.e., the physical workshop that implements this RMS. More specifically, we study the machine layout problem by considering the family product evolution where two sub-problems are considered. The first sub-problem concerns the evolution of the product, in the same family, towards new products to meet the evolutions and the requirements of the customers. The second sub-problem deals with the machine layout problem based on the results of the first sub-problem. We develop an approach which combines the well-known metaheuristic, archived multi-objective simulated annealing (AMOSA), with an exhaustive search-based heuristic to determine the best machine layout for all the selected machines of our product family. The approach is based on the initially generated process plans of products (in the product family) for the RMS design under performance metrics. The proposed layout must at its best, respects both the constraints imposed by the generated process plans and those depicting the available location in the shop floor where machines can be placed. To show the applicability of our approach, we present a simple numerical example and discuss the obtained numerical results.

The objective is to increase the ROV maneuverability by exploiting the mechanical model of the cable that links the ROV to an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV). The efforts applied on the umbilical are studied in simulation. The numerical models implemented under Simulink (TM) and Vortex (TM) are used to define new strategies of control for the winch, the USV and the ROV in order to manage the umbilical.

Integral data assimilation of the MERCI-1 experiment for the nuclear data associated with the PWR decay heat computation								EPJ Web of Conferences				211						07004	10.1051/epjconf/201921107004			2019	2019	Nuclear decay heat is a crucial issue for PWR in-core safety after reactor shutdown and back-end cycle. It is a dimensioning parameter for safety injection systems (SIS) to avoid a dewatering of the reactor core. The decay heat uncertainty needs to be controlled over the largest range of applications. The assimilation of the MERCI-1 experiment was studied to provide feedbacks on nuclear data. This experiment consisted in the measurement of the decay heat of a PWR UOX fuel sample irradiated in the OSIRIS reactor, for cooling times between 45 minutes and 42 days. More specifically, the consideration of several experimental values of MERCI-1 at different cooling times was tested. This raised issues about correlations to consider between different measurements. Besides, the impact of considering correlations between independent fission yields in covariance matrices on the decay heat uncertainty calculation and on the feedbacks on nuclear data is discussed.

Can its dynamics create/destroy nodes? On the one hand, since the nodes are the principal carriers of information, it seems that they cannot be destroyed without jeopardising bijectivity. On the other hand, there are plenty of global functions from graphs to graphs that are non-vertex-preserving and bijective. The question has been answered negatively-in three different ways. Yet, in this paper we do obtain reversible local node creation/destruction-in three relaxed settings, whose equivalence we prove for robustness. We motivate our work both by theoretical computer science considerations (reversible computing, cellular automata extensions) and theoretical physics concerns (basic formalisms towards discrete quantum gravity).

The goal of the controller is to play according to an accepting lasso of the automaton, while resisting to timing perturbations chosen by a competing environment. The problem was previously shown to be PSPACE-complete using regions-based techniques, but we provide a first tool solving the problem using zones only, thus more resilient to state-space explosion problem. The key ingredient is the introduction of branching constraint graphs allowing to decide in polynomial time whether a given lasso is robust, and even compute the largest admissible perturbation if it is. We also make an original use of constraint graphs in this context in order to test the inclusion of timed reachability relations, crucial for the termination criterion of our algorithm. Our techniques are illustrated using a case study on the regulation of a train network.

In some cases, pure syntactic features cannot be used for prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation while visual features could help. In this work, we are interested in the impact of the integration of such features in a parsing system. We propose a correction strategy pipeline for prepositional attachments using visual information, trained on a multimodal corpus of images and captions. The evaluation of the system shows us that using visual features allows, in certain cases, to correct the errors of a parser. It also helps to identify the most difficult aspects of such integration.

As most studies have focused on the fate of its production, temporal and plant part-specific variations of isotopic composition and biochemical content were overlooked. Combined seasonal and plant-part stable isotope composition and biochemical concentrations were measured at the lower depth limit of a P. oceanica meadow (similar to 25 meter depth), and explained on the basis of previous knowledge of the specific metabolic functioning of each part. The predominance of compounds with complex chemical structure was reflected by the high concentrations of insoluble carbohydrates, high C/N ratios and high delta C-13 values. Plant parts clustered in 3 groups with similar isotopic or biochemical features and metabolism: rhizomes and juvenile leaves, intermediate and adult leaves, senescent and drifting leaves. This result agrees with the vegetative phenology of the plant. The biochemical composition and the isotopic composition of the plant parts were consistent with previous knowledge regarding the photosynthetic activity and its seasonal variation. Correlations were fbund between N-linked descriptors (delta N-13 and protein content), and between delta C-13 and insoluble carbohydrate concentration. Epibiont values differed considerably from those of the leaf, as this community is taxonomically diverse and seasonally variable. Biochemical and isotopic composition measured confirmed that the current complex metabolism of P. oceanica results from adaptations to the specific features of life in a marine oligotrophic environment.

Electron-electron interactions strongly affect the dynamics of the generated pulses, leading to their fractionalization. In particular, on the innermost edge channel two oppositely charged excitations emerge, which we analyze through their Wigner function. Moreover, we show that interactions provide a signature in the noise generated when these excitations are partitioned by a quantum point contact connecting opposite edges. We compare different shapes of the external drive and we discuss the most convenient in order to extract information about the so-called mixing angle, encoding the strength of interactions between edge channels.

Automatically predicting customer satisfaction directly from system logs, without any survey or manual annotation is a challenging task of a great interest for the field of human-human conversation understanding and for improving contact center quality of service. Unlike previous studies that have focused on questions directly related to the content of a conversation, we look at a more general opinion about a service which is called the "Net Promoter Score" (NPS) where customers are considered either as promoters, detractors or neutral. On a very large corpus of chat-conversations with customer satisfaction surveys, we explore several classification scheme in order to achieve this prediction task, only using conversation logs.

In this work, we demonstrate that we can obtain a high definition 3D track of deep diving cetaceans from a five-channel, small-aperture hydrophone array on a moving autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), enabled by the vessel's hydrodynamic quality and a high recording sample rate. Real-time processing is achieved by splitting our non-uniform array into two parts for time delay of arrival estimation. Resulting 3D tracks depict the behavior of the cetacean in the abyss (1.2 km), with one position per second. This high resolution allows us to observe a correlation between the repetition rate of the predator's biosonar and the tortuosity of its track. Our proposed mobile observatory may offer new insights about whale behavior and its foraging success close to vessel traffic.

For a given dataset and a given machine learning-based task, a plethora of data preprocessing techniques and alternative data curation strategies may lead to dramatically different outputs with unequal quality performance. Most current work on data cleaning and automated machine learning, however, focus on developing either cleaning algorithms or user-guided systems or argue to rely on a principled method to select the sequence of data preprocessing steps that can lead to the optimal quality performance of. In this paper, we propose Learn2Clean, a method based on Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that selects, for a given dataset, a ML model, and a quality performance metric, the optimal sequence of tasks for preprocessing the data such that the quality of the ML model result is maximized. As a preliminary validation of our approach in the context of Web data analytics, we present some promising results on data preparation for clustering, regression, and classification on real-world data.

Four stations located in two regions of the Tunisian coasts were sampled. Leaf morphological and anatomical characters used in taxonomic identification were measured (e.g., number of cross veins, shape of the apex). The genetic study was performed using three most common chloroplast markers for plant characterization (DNA barcodes rbcL, matK and trnHpsbA). The morphological study revealed the presence of three C. nodosa morphotypes, described here for the first time, while the molecular characterization did not allow the discrimination of these morphological types. In regard to these results, it would be wise to review the classical identification keys of the Cymodocea genus.

In seawater, trace metals have a strong affinity for particulate organic matter or clay mineral and tend to accumulate in sediments. However, natural events and human activities can cause disturbances in surface sediments involving modification of chemical balances and contamination of surrounding waters. Here, we investigated the dynamics of trace metals in the Sfax coastal area (Gulf of Gabes, southern Mediterranean Sea), a shallow coastal ecosystem impacted by tides and submitted to urban/industrial effluents. We presented the spatial distribution of trace metals concentrations, their potential mobility in sediments and evaluated the potential sources of target elements in surface waters. The highest concentration levels in surficial sediments (3.51 mu g/g) and surface waters (0.25 mu g/L) were found for Cd. The latter showed a great affinity (50%) for the exchangeable phase while other elements (Cu, Cr and Ni) were found in most residual phases, reducing the environmental risk. Pb and Zn, associated Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides revealed potential inputs from urban and industrial effluents. Multivariate statistical analysis suggested that dissolved trace metals in surface waters were probably derived from effluents/wadis but also from sediment resuspension processes, induced by natural (tides, hydrodynamics) or anthropogenic (dredging) events. Overall, this study highlights the importance of the interactions between sediment and water column for the trace metal dynamics in very shallow coastal environments with an exacerbated pattern for Cd.

Ginoux and J. Llibre, Qual. Theory Dyn. Syst. 15 (2016) 381-431; J.M. Ginoux and J. Llibre, Qual. Theory Dyn. Syst. 15 (2015) 342010]. The aim of this work is to extend this method which improves the classical ones used till now to the case of three-dimensional singularly perturbed systems with two fast variables. This method enables to state a unique generic condition for the existence of "canard solutions" for such three-dimensional singularly perturbed systems which is based on the stability of folded singularities (pseudo singular points in this case) of the normalized slow dynamics deduced from a well-known property of linear algebra. Applications of this method to a famous neuronal bursting model enables to show the existence of "canard solutions" in the Hindmarsh-Rose model.

Our objective is to analyse the terminological complexity and instability of terms referring to the controversial notion of biocontrol (lutte biologique in French) in two types of publications. The analysis is based on the identification of the different denominations used in this interdisciplinary subject field, both in a Journal specialized in plant protection and in the most popular French daily newspapers. Our study aims to give an in-depth linguistic and cognitive analysis of French terms and explain the reasons for the observed variation. As most scientific research topics gaining public attention, biological control (or biocontrol) is prone to a multiplication of terms. In this study, we show how the profusion of terms, in a domain with important scientific and societal implications, can maintain or even exacerbate terminological and conceptual confusion.

The localization of these traps has been established by a comparative study using capacitance and current deep level transient spectroscopies (DLTS). The C-gd-DLTS measurements cover the GaN buffer region between the gate and drain contacts. On the other hand, the I-DS-DLTS measurements cover the channel region in GaN including the zone under the gate. Two electron traps, E2 (0.31eV) and E4 (0.5eV) have been detected. They are respectively attributed to reactive ion etching (RIE) induced surface damage. These two traps are more likely located in the GaN channel close to the gate. Two other deep electron traps E5 (0.64eV) and E6 (0.79eV) have also been detected and are localized in the GaN buffer layer.

Plastic behaviour and deformation mechanisms in silicon nano-objects								Journal of Physics Conference Series				1190						012004	10.1088/1742-6596/1190/1/012004			2019	2019	Physical properties of nano-objects differ from what they are in bulk materials when the size decreases down to the nanometre scale. This behavioural change, named size effect, also applies to mechanical properties and has been evidenced in various materials. For instance, at low temperature, bulk silicon is known to be a brittle material while silicon nano-objects exhibit a ductile behavior. Although mechanical properties of silicon have been intensively studied over the last decades, the origin of this remarkable brittle-to-ductile transition at small scales remains, however, undetermined. In this article, a study of the plastic behaviour of nano-pillars is reported. The main results obtained from the combination of numerical calculations and experimental compression tests followed by atomically-resolved transmission electron microscopy imaging are described. We discuss the possibility for perfect dislocations to dissociate at low temperature and the underrated role of shuffle partial dislocations in plastic deformation of silicon. The formation of unexpected extended defects in the {115} planes with increasing plastic strain, also appears as a key-factor leading to the transition between ductile and brittle regimes at small scales.

In Knowledge Graphs, part of the data preparation and cleaning processes, such as data linking, identity disambiguation, or missing value inference and completion could be automated by making a ML model "learn" and predict the matches routinely with different degrees of supervision. This talk will survey the recent trends of applying machine learning solutions to improve and facilitate Knowledge Graph curation and enrichment, as one of the most critical tasks impacting Web search and query-answering. Finally, the talk will discuss the next research challenges in the convergence of machine learning and management of Knowledge Graph evolution and preservation.

It impacts the efficiency of exploring the search space and exploiting the problem structure. In this paper, we propose Conflict-History Search (CHS), a dynamic and adaptive branching heuristic for CSP solving. It is based on the search failures and considers the temporality of these failures throughout the resolution process. The exponential recencyweighted average is used to estimate the evolution of the hardness of constraints throughout the search. The experimental evaluation on XCSP3 instances shows that integrating CHS to solvers based on MAC obtains competitive results and can improve those obtained by other heuristics of the state of the art, such as dom/wde. and ABS.

In this work, an automated algorithm that calculates the deposition path, the tool orientations and the local inter-layer distances is presented. Then, an adaptive travel speed strategy is applied to adjust the bead morphology to the local layer height.

This catalyst was found to be highly active and selective, affording a high yield of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones/thiones. These reactions were performed via conventional heating in water or under microwave irradiation. Compared to the classical Biginelli reaction conditions, this new approach consistently has the advantage of excellent yields, short reaction times, simple and convenient procedure, inexpensive reagents and eco-friendly preparation.

This model works for bipolar devices that have filamentary-type conduction and it is based on the circuit representation of the conductive filament (CF). The stochastic nature of the switching process, observed in experimental data, has been included by using a switching probability to control CF changes, and therefore, the ReRAM's state. For calibration, the analysis of current-voltage curves of devices of six different areas (nm 2 range) has been done. Good agreement between the experimental results and the model simulation were found.

One of such violent female characters is Gilda, from La serrana de la Vera. These remarks will mainly examine and compare aspects of this character, as the site of convergence and fusion of multiple, heterogeneous, pre-existing materials. The first staging of Luis Velez de Guevara's tragedy La serrana de la Vera took place in July 1613, casting the famous and sulphurous actress Jusepa Vaca, for whom the play had been written. The actress' husband and auctor de comedias Morales Medrano staged the play. Director Maria Ruiz staged a version of the Spanish Golden play - written by novelist Luis Landero-in a 2004 production of the "Compania Nacional de Teatro Clasico" in the Pavon theatre in Madrid. These remarks will measure the impact of the dramatic and ideological changes made on Velez's creative schemes.

Black silicon (BS) using room temperature reactive ion etching (RT- RIE) for interdigitated back contact (IBC) silicon solar cells								Proceedings of SPIE				10913						UNSP 109130U	10.1117/12.2509326			2019	2019	Black silicon processing is a promising research area to improve optical properties of silicon solar cells. Currently, RIE method is used at cryogenic temperature because it enables a very good control of shapes of nano-structures but working at cryogenic temperature in a clean room can be an issue. In order to produce black silicon under realistic industrial conditions, room temperature process has to be achieved. We present a study aiming at etching silicon wafer surfaces using "Room Temperature SF6/O-2 Reactive Ion Etching" (RT-RIE). The BS obtained using RT-RIE results in a morphology consisting of 850 nm height pillars densely and randomly distributed onto the silicon surface. We show that the shape, density and height of nano-structures are modified by small variations of the parameter process due to the sensitive competition between etching and passivation mechanisms. The BS exhibits a reflectance below 1% in the whole visible wavelength range. The next step is the integration of this BS into interdigitated back contacts (IBC) solar cells. We then model IBC solar cells using the Silvaco software. The surface recombination velocity is strongly enhanced with BS and charges cannot be collected at the back of the cell. The charges generated by photon absorption within the first micrometers of the cells are recombined before being collected at the back contact. A front passivation is then necessary to reduce this strong surface recombination velocity. As a result, simulation exhibits efficiency variations from 1% without passivation to 23% with high quality passivation.		[Atteia, F.; Le Rouzo, J.; Simon, J.

We are mostly interested in Hamiltonians modeling graphene antidot lattices with impurities. The unperturbed operator H-0 := D-S + V-0 is the sum of a Dirac-like operator D-S plus a periodic matrix-valued potential V-0, and is assumed to have an open gap. The random potential V-omega is of Anderson-type with independent, identically distributed coupling constants and moving centers, with absolutely continuous probability distributions. We prove band edge localization, namely that there exists an interval of energies in the unperturbed gap where the almost sure spectrum of the family H-omega := H-0 + V-omega is dense pure point, with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions, that give rise to dynamical localization.

However for plants and active ingredients (of mineral and animal origin), it is necessary to consume very large quantities to achieve what is called the health claim dose, i.e., the dose for which the effect on health claim is established. Camellia sinensis leaves is traditionally used as plant infusion. This article aims to review the innovation afforded by the ABC (Bio Concentrate Assets (R)) patent. The ABC patent has developed an exclusive method of enriching organic tea leaves with organic herbal dry plant extracts using organic acacia gum. This method allows the coupling of concentrated dry extracts from medicinal plants on the Camellia sinensis leave extracts using acacia gum (arabic gum) and to reach to low enough health claim doses thanks to a higher concentration of active ingredients (tested until 10 ingredients). An example of ABC application is provided in a brief overview of manufacturing process for the "Gingo (R) tea" preparation. The main advantages of the ABC patent application are discussed. In conclusion, the ABC process offers a real breakthrough in the market of teas and herbal teas for health and wellness.

Two important degradation mechanisms are proposed related to the transistor bias and the increase of its temperature. This study consists to push the studied transistor to operate in an aging mode by imposing particular bias conditions and excessive junction temperature. Based on some electrical quantities, such as drain leakage current and on the junction temperature, the behavior of the transistor is deduced when operating in aging mode. The simulation results obtained show that during these particular operations, the junction temperature increases, which may destroy the transistor.		[Baghaz, E.; Naamane, A.; M'sirdi, N.

Some power-supply designers have found it easier to use a D/DC, full-bridge converter. This is because this kind of converter can obtain zero-voltage switching on the primary side of the converter reducing switching losses, and EMI and increasing overall efficiency. The purpose of this paper is the design of a switch mode power supply for industrial applications (vehicle charger, power supply for a helicopter.,) This Full Bridge DC/DC converter controlled by an analog control. This shows several advantages as simple implementation, compactness with satisfactory performance. The simulation results obtained are compared with a Full Bridge Converter controlled by UCC28950 which is a digital Texas Instruments device. The designed power supply operates with an efficiency of more than 90%.		[Baghaz, E.; Naamane, A.; M'sirdi, N.

For the heating needs a house with 4 rooms is modeled and simulated in Matlab/simulink to predict the needed power. The thermal characteristic and model parameters are deduced for the architectural studies and design using architects soft-wares. We assume that 4 to 5 people live in this house of 100 m(2). Despite the question seems classical, for going toward zero energy buildings, it has never been considered scientifically to define a complete set of models and simulations. In this work, we measured the consumption of each one of the house loads to be able to have a corresponding models. Detailed results can be available in an internal report and a PhD report.

J	Cozzi, Stefano; Ibanez, Carles; Lazar, Luminita; Raimbault, Patrick; Giani, Michele								Flow Regime and Nutrient-Loading Trends from the Largest South European Watersheds: Implications for the Productivity of Mediterranean and Black Sea's Coastal Areas								WATER				11	1					1	10.3390/w11010001			JAN 2019	2019	In the last century, large watersheds in Southern Europe have been impacted by a combination of anthropogenic and climatic pressures, which have rapidly evolved to change the ecological status of freshwater and coastal systems. A comparative analysis was performed for Ebro, Rhone, Po and Danube rivers, to investigate if they exhibited differential dynamics in hydrology and water quality that can be linked to specific human and natural forces acting at sub-continental scales. Flow regime series were analyzed from daily to multi-decadal scales, considering frequency distributions, trends (Mann-Kendall and Sen tests) and discontinuities (SRSD Method). River loads of suspended matter, nutrients and organic matter and the eutrophication potential of river nutrients were estimated to assess the impact of river loads on adjacent coastal areas. The decline of freshwater resources largely impacted the Ebro watershed on annual (-0.139 km(3) yr(-1)) and seasonal (-0.4% yr(-1)) scales. In the other rivers, only spring-summer showed significant decreases of the runoff coupled to an exacerbated flow variability (0.1-0.3% yr(-1)), which suggested the presence of an enhanced regional climatic instability. Discontinuities in annual runoff series (every 20-30 years) indicated a similar long-term evolution of Rhone and Po rivers, differently from Ebro and Danube. Higher nutrient concentrations in the Ebro and Po (+50%) compared to Rhone and Danube and distinct stoichiometric nutrient ratios may exert specific impacts on the growth of plankton biomass in coastal areas. The overall decline of inorganic phosphorus in the Rhone and Po (since the 1980s) and the Ebro and Danube (since the 1990s) mitigated the eutrophication in coastal ecosystems inducing, however, a phase in which the role of organic phosphorus loads (Po > Danube > Rhone > Ebro) on coastal productivity could be more relevant. Overall, the study showed that the largest South European watersheds are differently impacted by anthropogenic and climatic forces and that this will influence their vulnerability to future changes of flow regime and water quality.

J	Aldebert, Clement; Kooi, Bob W.; Nerini, David; Gauduchon, Mathias; Poggiale, Jean-Christophe								THREE-DIMENSIONAL BIFURCATION ANALYSIS OF A PREDATOR-PREY MODEL WITH UNCERTAIN FORMULATION								SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS				79	1			377	395		10.1137/18M1189257			2019	2019	An issue in mathematical modeling is that multiple models describe the same data based on different but all acceptable theoretical assumptions. To take this uncertainty in model construction into account, the classical parameter sensitivity analysis needs to be extended to consider alternative choices in model formulation. This is particularly important in population biology, where a single function often summarizes mechanisms from the physiological to the population level. Predictions based on population models were recently shown to be sometimes highly sensitive to the function that models predation. This so-called structural sensitivity extends the classical structural stability. It arises from differences between the bifurcation diagrams based on alternative model formulations. Here, we ask through an example of a predator-prey system that exhibits complex bifurcations (involving limit cycles and homoclinic orbits) how the qualitative changes in bifurcations occur during a small continuous switch between two acceptable model formulations. In this model, fixed parameter values are estimated from empirical data, free parameters allow one to explore a wide range of environmental conditions and species, and a remaining parameter makes a switch between two predation formulations. Thus, the change in model formulation becomes a parameter sensitivity problem that is studied by bifurcation analysis. A three-dimensional analysis revealed that most changes that occur with the change in formulation are related to a codimension-three degenerated Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Its canonical unfolding is derived, and its analysis highlights the differences in the phase portraits predicted with the two model formulations. Differences that are not related to this bifurcation are also discussed. The discussion ends with some perspectives toward the quantification of prediction uncertainty due to uncertainty in model structure in ecology, and possibly in other fields involving the modeling of complex systems.

This consisted of a rare opportunity to investigate the deep continental biosphere that is still poorly known. Four rock cores, from 1709, 1804, 1865, and 1935 m below land surface, were collected from Lower and Middle Triassic formations in the Paris Basin (France) to investigate their microbial and geochemical composition. Rock leachates showed high salinities ranging from 100 to 365 g.L-1 NaCl, current temperatures averaging 65 degrees C, no detectable organic matter, and very fine porosity. Microbial composition was studied using a dual cultural and molecular approach. While the broad-spectrum cultural media that was used to activate microbial communities was unsuccessful, the genetic investigation of the dominant 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed eight bacterial genera considered as truly indigenous to the Triassic cores. Retrieved taxa were affiliated to aerobic and facultative anaerobic taxon, mostly unknown to grow in very saline media, except for one taxon related to Halomonas. They included Firmicutes and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria members that are known from many subsurface environments and deep terrestrial and marine ecosystems. As suggested by geochemical analyses of rocks and rock leachates, part of the indigenous bacterial community may originate from a cold paleo-recharge of the Trias aquifer with water originating from ice melting. Thus, retrieved DNA would be fossil DNA. As previously put forward to explain the lack of evidence of microbial life in deep sandstone, another hypothesis is a possible paleo-sterilisation that is based on the poly-extremophilic character of the confined Triassic sandstones, which present high salinity and temperature.

Of the most informative trace elements within otoliths (the twelve isotopes Na-23, Mg-25, Ca-43, Mn-55, Co-59, Ni-60, Cu-63, Zn-66, Sr-86, Cd-111, Ba-138 and Pb-208) only three ratios of Ca (Na:Ca, Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) were informative and therefore used in a multivariate regression-tree analysis. Using a multivariate partitioning, three main phases were described from profiles, including the larval life phase (leptocephali), the intermediate phase (longest section between the larval life phase and the terminal phase) and the terminal phase (final section i.e., the most recent months preceding the death of fish). According to concentrations of the three ratios to Ca, G. chilospilus can be separated into three groups during their larval life stage (very different in Sr and Na), four groups during the intermediate phase (few differences in Sr and Na) and three groups during the terminal phase (differences in Sr), illustrating that G. chilospilus inhabit different habitats during these three phases. Our results showed that the leptocephali encountered different oceanic water masses with fluctuating Sr:Ca ratios during the early larval phase. During the intermediate phase (main part of their life-span), they lived in lagoonal waters such as fringing reefs or reef flats of lagoonal islets, characterized by a lower Sr:Ca ratio. During the latter part of their life, approximately one third of G. chilospilus encountered more oceanic waters close to or at barrier reefs, suggesting possible movements of these fish along a coast-to-ocean gradient.

However, the latter has been shown to be solely a protective mechanism. By implementing the oxygen-driven experimental evolution of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, we have obtained strains that have evolved to grow with energy derived from oxidative phosphorylation linked to oxygen reduction. We show that a few mutations are sufficient for the emergence of this phenotype and reveal two routes of evolution primarily involving either inactivation or overexpression of the gene encoding heterodisulfide reductase. We propose that the oxygen respiration for energy conservation that sustains the growth of the O-2-evolved strains is associated with a rearrangement of metabolite fluxes, especially NAD(+)/NADH, leading to an optimized O-2 reduction. These evolved strains are the first sulfate-reducing bacteria that exhibit a demonstrated oxygen respiratory process that enables growth.

Beyond floating-gate memory technologies, bipolar resistive random access memories (RRAM) appear to be one of the most promising technologies. However, when organized in 1 or 2-transistor 1-RRAM (1T1R, 2T1R) architectures, they suffer from large bitcell area, degraded performance, and reliability issue during reset operation. The association of multiple-independent-gate polarity controllable transistors (PCT) with RRAM overcomes these drawbacks while providing a dense structure. In this paper, we present two innovative PCT-based bitcells and propose an extensive study of their functionality, physical design considerations, and performances in read and write operations compared to CMOS-based 1T1R and 2T1R bitcells. The proposed bitcells outperform the performances of 1T1R and 2T1R bitcells in reset (5x to 105x speed improvement) and are competitive in term of area (1.35x to 2.6x area reduction versus 2T1R) and avoid gate overdrive (1.2 V versus more than 2 V in 1T1R bitcells), thus reducing selector reliability concerns. We also propose an innovative programming strategy that takes advantage of the PCT polarity control and enables 500x improvement in reset performance. Finally, the proposed bitcells perform 15%-67% faster than CMOS bitcells in read.

It makes use of the fact that the thermodynamic pressure has small variations in this regime. These equations of state supplement the 2D LMNC model introduced in previous works. Our innovative strategy relies on tabulated values and is proven to satisfy crucial thermodynamic requirements such as positivity, monotonicity and continuity. In particular, saturation values are exact. This procedure is assessed by means of analytical steady solutions and comparisons with standard analytical equations of state, and shows a great improvement in accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, two common plastic materials, an insulation layer of electric cables (polyvinyl chloride, PVC-cables) and plastic garbage bag (polyethylene, PE-bags), were incubated in natural seawater under laboratory conditions, and the PAE migration to the seawater phase was studied with varying light and bacterial conditions over a 90-day time course. Free PAEs diluted in seawater were also studied for bacterial degradation. Our results showed that, within the first month of incubation, both plastic materials significantly leached out PAEs into the surrounding water. We found that di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) were the main PAEs released from the PE-bags, with the highest values of 83.4 +/- 12.5 and 120.1 +/- 18.0 ng g(-1) of plastic, respectively. Furthermore, dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were the main PAEs released from PVC-cables, with mass fractions as high as 9.5 +/- 1.4 and 68.9 +/- 10.3 ng g(-1), respectively. Additionally, we found that light and bacterial exposure increased the total amount of PAEs released from PVC-cables by a factor of up to 5, whereas they had no influence in the case of PE-bags.

Community-wide adoption of MIUViG standards, which complement the Minimum Information about a Single Amplified Genome (MISAG) and Metagenome-Assembled Genome (M I MAG) standards for uncultivated bacteria and archaea, will improve the reporting of uncultivated virus genomes in public databases. In turn, this should enable more robust comparative studies and a systematic exploration of the global virosphere.

J	Cristia, Maximiliano; Hollmann, Diego A.; Frydman, Claudia								A multi-target compiler for CML-DEVS								SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL				95	1			11	29		10.1177/0037549718765080			JAN 2019	2019	Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) is a modular and hierarchical formalism for system modeling and simulation. DEVS models can be mathematically described; simulation is performed by tools called concrete simulators. Concerning atomic DEVS models, each concrete simulator has its own input language which is, essentially, a general-purpose programming language (such as Java or C++). Hence, once engineers have written the mathematical model, they need to manually translate it into the input language of the concrete simulator of their choice. In this paper we present a multi-target compiler for atomic DEVS models written in CML-DEVS, a mathematics-based DEVS modeling language. This multi-target compiler is able to compile a CML-DEVS model to the input languages of the PowerDEVS and DEVS-Suite concrete simulators. In this way, the CML-DEVS compiler frees engineers from the manual translation of their mathematical models. In fact, the same mathematical model can be simulated on both simulators by simply recompiling the model. The CML-DEVS multi-target compiler can be easily extended to produce code for other concrete simulators.

J	Haddad, F.; Rahajandraibe, W.; Ghorbel, I			IEEE					A CMOS Digitally Controlled Oscillator for reconfigurable RF applications								Mediterranean Microwave Symposium														2019	2019	This paper presents a design of a CMOS digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) using a tunable active inductor (TAI) to reduce the area and cost for reconfigurable multi-band RF applications. The compatibility of this circuit to different wireless standards shows its potential to be implemented for the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed TAI, based on a gyrator-C topology, achieves coarse frequency tuning due to a 4-bit digitally controlled current source. Implemented in 130 nm CMOS technology, the DCO occupies an area of only (52 x 48) mu m(2). The circuit offers a frequency tuning from 1.65 GHz to 2.5 GHz for a 4-bit digital control word in [1, 15]. The optimal phase noise is about -87 dBc/Hz @1 MHz offset with power consumption varying from 2.6 mW to 5 mW at a supply voltage of 1.1 V when changing the control word digitally from 1 to 15.

Unfortunately, such basic information is often only partially available for professional stakeholders, teachers, scientists and citizens, and often incomplete for ecosystems that possess the highest diversity. In this context, an ultimate ambition is to set up innovative information systems relying on the automated identification and understanding of living organisms as a means to engage massive crowds of observers and boost the production of biodiversity and agro-biodiversity data. The Life-CLEF 2019 initiative proposes three data-oriented challenges related to this vision, in the continuity of the previous editions but with several consistent novelties intended to push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art in several research directions. This paper describes the methodology of the conducted evaluations as well as the synthesis of the main results and lessons learned.

J	Balestriero, Randall; Glotin, Herve			IEEE					Wavelet Learning by Adaptive Hermite Cubic Splines applied to Bioacoustic Chirps								OCEANS-IEEE														2019	2019	Acoustic monitoring is used to study marine mammals in oceans. Automated analysis for captured sound is almost essential because of the large quantity of data. The deep learning approach is an efficient method, however acoustic features are often not adapted. Convolutional Neural Net can be seen as an optimal kernel decomposition, nevertheless it requires large amount of training data to learn its kernels. An alternative using pre-imposed kernels and thus not requiring any amount of data is the scattering framework which imposes as kernels wavelet filters. Our research focuses on adaptive time-frequency decomposition of bioacoustic signal, based on cubic spline learning representation. We give the theoretical derivations of the model, and demonstrates efficient real applications of various signal, including chirps of songs of Blue Whale.

Static hydrophone arrays monitor from a fixed location, however, they cannot track animals over long distances. More flexibility can be achieved by mounting hydrophones on a mobile structure. In this paper, we present the design of a small non -uniform array of five hydrophones mounted directly under the Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) Sphyrna (also called an Autonomous Laboratory Vehicle) built by SeaProven in France. This configuration is made challenging by the 40cm aperture of the hydrophone array, extending only two meters below the surface and above the thermocline, thus presenting various artifacts. The array, fixed under the keel of the drone, is numerically stabilized in yaw and roll using the drone's Motion Processing Unit (MPU). To increase the accuracy of the 3D tracking computed from a four hour recording of a Sperm Whale diving several kilometers away, we propose an efficient joint filtering of the clicks in the Time Delay of Arrival (TDoA) space. We show how the DBSCAN algorithm efficiently removes any outlier detection among the thousands of transients, and yields to coherent high definition 3D tracks.

Two different techniques for handling fluid-solid boundaries (mirroring and Shepard extrapolation) and two different pressure calculation methods (pressure projection and state equation) are investigated. The first contribution of this paper is to propose a test case with a submerged sphere in a water tank, in which the evolution of fluid pressure over depth is watched to compare the accuracy of the boundary handling techniques and the pressure calculations methods. The second contribution of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of the solvers in dynamic cases, looking at the evolution of the pressure over time, the evolution of sphere speed over time and comparing with an analytical falling speed based on added mass and/or velocity damping. Third contribution of this paper is to evaluate the solvers using performance metrics based on computational time and time step counts. The results showed that the solver using pressure projection and Shepard extrapolation have reliable accuracy and good computational efficiency and might be a favored approach towards achieving accurate real-time simulation of underwater vehicles.

J	Laranjeira, Matheus; Dune, Claire; Hugel, Vincent			IEEE					Embedded Visual Detection and Shape Identification of Underwater Umbilical for Vehicle Positioning								OCEANS-IEEE														2019	2019	Tethers are used in underwater operations to supply power and to transfer data transfer between underwater robots and a surface vessel. The real-time tracking of an underwater cable can he useful to make exploration missions and teleoperation safer by avoiding collisions and entanglement. This paper introduces a new method to detect and to estimate the 3D shape parameters of an underwater umbilical thanks to embedded visual and depth sensors. The tether buoyancy is assumed to be slightly negative, and the tether shape is approximated with a catenary curve whose lowest point is assumed to remain between the attachment points. The estimation of the cable parameters is based on a nonlinear least-square tilting procedure where the cable projection in the image is fitted with the 2D projection of the catenary shape. The underlying Gauss Newton algorithm is improved thanks to an initial guess, and a four step process that handles the calculation of the residual error between the detected points and the fitted curve using saturation, subsampling, M-estimation, and bounded iteration. Simulation is conducted in a test tank using a compact underwater robot connected to a 1.5m orange tether. The results obtained show that the method gives satisfactory results. This tether detection and shape identification can therefore be used by the robot to position itself with respect to the tether or with respect to the vessel at the other end.

We also exploited a recording device, Bombyx II, for one and a half months, with visual monitoring of the zone by a group of experts. We find that the method applied to the south east Pacific song of blue whales gives theoretical results of about 50% success in position recovery. Since we have redundancy in our data, we were able to locate the whale with a precision of 500 m over a box of 10 km by 5 km in the case when we have both visual detection and a strong acoustic signal. More tests should be performed before validating this method, but these first results are encouraging.

J	Poupard, Marion; de Montgolfier, Benjamin; Glotin, Herve			IEEE					Ethoacoustic by bayesian non parametric and stochastic neighbor embedding to forecast anthropic pressure on dolphins								OCEANS-IEEE														2019	2019	Marine mammals are found in every sea worldwide and are at the highest level of the marine food chain. They communicate among themselves through sounds. It is complicated to study and to characterize these populations because they spend most of their time below the surface. Nevertheless, it is possible to analyze, characterize and classify different cetacean species through the use of bioacoustics. Our study focuses on the Pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), in particular on the influence of nautical tourism, i.e. whale-watching boats, in the Caribbean Sea on dolphin communications. The objective of this study was to observe the correlation between dolphin behaviours and whistles. The most appropriate methods had to be implemented in order to analyze ethoacoustic data. To achieve this, we compared a manual method with an automatic whistle detector. Then, we used different methods of projection (ACP and t-SNE) to reduce the dimension of acoustic data. We concluded by clustering the sounds versus the behavioural classes. The results showed that our automatic method was effective as different clusters were identified : pantropical spotted dolphin do not communicate in the same manner when they are surrounded by whale-watching boats, or during socialization. Therefore, acoustic survey is an efficient non-intrusive way to characterize the form of communication and to evaluate impacts of noise on cetaceans. Our method is effective and provides opportunities for acoustic surveys of anthropophonic pollution.

Acoustic monitoring is used to study marine mammals in oceans, and gives us information for understanding cetacean life, such as their behaviour, movement or reproduction. Automated analysis for captured sound is almost essential because of the large quantity of data. A deep learning approach was chosen for this task, since it has proven great efficiency for answering such problematics. This study focused on the orcas (Orcinus orca) of northern Vancouver Island, Canada, in collaboration with the NGO Orcalab which developed a multihydrophone recording station around Hanson Island to study orcas. The acoustic station is composed of 5 hydrophones and extends over 50 km2 of ocean. Since 2016 we are continuously streaming the hydrophone signals to our laboratory at Toulon, France, yielding nearly 50 TB of synchronous multichannel recordings. The objective for this research is to do a preliminary analysis of the collected data and demonstrate influence of environmental factors (tidal, moon phase and daily period) on the orcas' acoustic activities.

In this paper, we consider the setting where the queried data are provided by several and potentially conflicting sources. We propose a merging approach, called "Assertional Removed Sets Fusion" (ARSF) for merging DL-Lite assertional bases. This approach stems from the inconsistency minimization principle and consists in determining the minimal subsets of assertions, called assertional removed sets, that need to be dropped from the original assertional bases in order to resolve conflicts between them. We give several merging strategies based on different definitions of minimality criteria, and we characterize the behaviour of these strategies with respect to rational properties. The last part of the paper shows how to use the notion of hitting sets for computing the assertional removed sets, and the merging outcome.

Therefore, every 4-connected planar graph decomposes into three forests, one having maximum degree at most 2. We use this result to show that any Hamiltonian planar triangulation can be decomposed into two trees and one spanning tree of maximum degree at most 3. These decompositions improve the result of Gonsalves (2009) [5] that every planar graph can be decomposed into three forests, one of maximum degree at most 4. We also show that our results are best-possible. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of the roles of metals and humic fractions in the podzolization of soils from the Amazon region using two analytical spectroscopy techniques								MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL				144				454	460		10.1016/j.microc.2018.10.009			JAN 2019	2019	Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in environmental sustainability, since it is involved in carbon and nutrient cycling. Consequently, it is a key factor to consider in studies concerning global climate change and agronomy. Among the main components of SOM are humic substances (HS), which are divided, according to their solubility, into humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and humin (HU) fractions. Study of the chemical properties of this organic matter is important for understanding the biogeochemical processes occurring in the soil. The aim of this work was to determine the metals iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), in order to elucidate the role of organic matter in the transport of these metals in Amazonian soils. The results showed that FA was important for Al, while the HA fraction was more selective towards Fe. The translocations of these metals to deeper profiles in two different soils involved either young and less humified organic matter, or older organic matter with a low degree of humification. Therefore, these two humic fractions were involved in the process of soil podzolization, with FA having a predominant role in the transport of Al, while HA was mainly responsible for the transport of Fe.
