Morphological and electrical properties of La0.8Ca0.1Pb0.1FeO3 perovskite nanopowder for NH3 and CO gas detection								JOURNAL OF ELECTROCERAMICS											10.1007/s10832-020-00223-6				2020	Nanocrystalline gas sensitive material based on Perovskite type La0.8Ca0.1Pb0.1FeO3(LCPFO) sample has been prepared by the sol-gel method with the citric acid route. The gas sensitivities under different temperatures of the (LCPFO) compound have been investigated toward the two NH3 and CO reducing gases. The synthesized compound has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that the compound exhibits an orthorhombic symmetry with the Pnma space group. The effect of the experiment environment (under vacuum and air) on the conductance and activation energy E-a of the LCPFO compound has been evaluated. The E-a values have been found to be in the range of 0.43 eV < E-a < 0.53 eV and to be located between 0.42 and 0.62 eV under vacuum and air, respectively. Furthermore, the lowest detectable concentrations (10 and 40 ppm) of NH3 and CO, respectively, have been achieved.

Methods: A total of 528 volunteers (age >= 60 years) took the battery of 10 tests: 6-min walk, trunk strength, hand grip strength, medicine ball throwing, 30-s chair stand, flexibility, balance, plate tapping, ruler drop, and dual task. Results: Internal consistency was high, with the Cronbach alpha coefficients at around 0.77, explaining 64% of the variance. The test-retest correlations (0.3-0.6) between the items were acceptable and displayed an internal consistency property. Although five components explained 65% of the variance, all the items were kept because their eigenvalues were near to 0.9. External consistency was validated by a significant decrease in fitness scores (p < 0.001) with age and body mass index. Discussion: The Vitality Test Battery is a safe, valid tool for assessing physical fitness in persons aged over 60 years.

Nevertheless, its surface is not very compatible with most organic systems; hence, chemical functionalization methods offer a path to solve this problem. In this study, NFC is successfully functionalized with two silane coupling agents: 3-glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GPS) and 3-glycidyloxypropyl dimethylethoxysilane (GPMES) by a simple, direct, and environmentally friendly method. Different analyses have been carried out in order to confirm the chemical modification of NFC. ATR-IR, XPS, and Si-29 NMR spectroscopies confirmed the chemical modification that allowed the understanding of the structure and the conformation onto the modified NFC surface. SEM and AFM microscopies were performed to study possible alterations in morphology; a slight change was observed. Thermal properties were also analyzed by TGA analysis. It remains stable after chemical functionalization. Grafted NFC showed good performance compared to the pristine one. It allows a better dispersion into organic systems improving their properties.

Since 2011, blooms were regularly observed in warmer water, further south. Their developments in Central Atlantic are associated with mass strandings on the coasts, causing important damages and potentially dispersion of new bacteria. Microbiomes associated with pelagic Sargassum were analysed at large scale in Central Atlantic and near Caribbean Islands with a focus on pathogenic bacteria. Vibrio appeared widely distributed among pelagic Sargassum microbiome of our samples with higher occurrence than previously found in Mexico Gulf. Six out the 16 Vibrio-OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit), representing 812 +/- 13.1% of the sequences, felt in cluster containing pathogens. Among the four different microbial profiles of pelagic Sargassum microbiome, Vibrio attained about 2% in two profiles whereas it peaked, in the two others, at 6.5 and 26.8% respectively, largely above the concentrations found in seawater surrounding raft (0.5%). In addition to sampling and measurements, we performed backward lagrangian modelling of trajectories of rafts, and rebuilt the sampled rafts environmental history allowing us to estimate Sargassum growth rates along raft displacements. We found that Vibrio was favoured by high Sargassum growth rate and in situ ammonium and nitrite, modelled phosphate and nitrate concentrations, whereas zooplankters, benthic copepods, and calm wind (proxy of raft buoyancy near the sea surface) were less favourable for them. Relations between Vibrio and other main bacterial groups identified a competition with Alteromonas. According to forward Lagrangian tracking, part of rafts containing Vibrio could strand on the Caribbean coasts, however the strong decreases of modelled Sargassum growth rates along this displacement suggest unfavourable environment for Vibrio. For the conditions and areas observed, the sanitary risk seemed in consequence minor, but in other areas or conditions where high Sargassum growth rate occurred near coasts, it could be more important.

Fabrication of spectrally sharp Si-based dielectric resonators: combining etaloning with Mie resonances								OPTICS EXPRESS				28	25			37734	37742		10.1364/OE.409001			DEC 7 2020	2020	We use low-resolution optical lithography joined with solid state dewetting of crystalline, ultra-thin silicon on insulator (c-UT-SOI) to form monocrystalline, atomically smooth, silicon-based Mie resonators in well-controlled large periodic arrays. The dewetted islands have a typical size in the 100 nm range, about one order of magnitude smaller than the etching resolution. Exploiting a 2 mu m thick SiO2 layer separating the islands and the underlying bulk silicon wafer, we combine the resonant modes of the antennas with the etalon effect. This approach sets the resonance spectral position and improves the structural colorization and the contrast between scattering maxima and minima of individual resonant antennas. Our results demonstrate that templated dewetting enables the formation of defect-free, faceted islands that are much smaller than the nominal etching resolution and that an appropriate engineering of the substrate improves their scattering properties. These results are relevant to applications in spectral filtering, structural color and beam steering with all-dielectric photonic devices.

More specifically, we show how, introducing a quantum memory for each of the spatial grid, this result can be achieved simply by acting on the initial state of the whole system, and therefore can be exactly controlled once for all. As example we prove analytically how to encode in the initial state any arbitrary walker's mean trajectory and variance. This brings significantly closer the possibility of implementing dynamically interesting physics models on medium term quantum devices, and introduces a new direction in simulating aspects of quantum field theories (QFTs), notably on curved manifold.

Bioluminescence in an Undescribed Species of Carnivorous Sponge (Cladorhizidae) From the Deep Sea								FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE				7						576476	10.3389/fmars.2020.576476			DEC 3 2020	2020	One dominant ecological trait in the dimly-lit deep-sea is the ability of organisms to emit bioluminescence. Despite its many ecological roles in deep-sea ecosystems, the presence of inherent bioluminescence in marine sponges has been debated for more than a century. This work reports repeated observations of luminescence from six individuals of an undescribed carnivorous sponge species (Cladorhizidae) sampled near 4,000 m depth off Monterey Bay (CA, United States). These are the first fully documented records of bioluminescence in the phylum Porifera. Videos and photographs of the sponges' bioluminescence were recorded on board after collection and in vitro bioluminescence assays indicate that the bioluminescence system is a coelenterazine-based luciferase. Coelenterazine luciferin is already described in various organisms such as cnidarians, chaetognaths, copepods, cephalopods, ctenophores, ostracods, and some mysid or decapod shrimps. Based on these observations we discuss new ecological hypotheses of functional traits such as bioluminescence and carnivory in deep sea organisms.

While these species are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities, basic biological knowledge is still lacking. For instance, major uncertainties remain on the behaviour, ecology, and thus functional roles of mesopelagic micronektivores, particularly regarding their interactions with physicochemical features. Here, we examine the trophic ecology, habitat, and migratory behaviour of the viperfish (Chauliodus sloani)-a poorly known and abundant deep-sea species-to further understand the ecology and thus functional role of mesopelagic micronektivores. Moreover, we explore how physical drivers may affect these features and how these relationships are likely to change over large oceanic areas. The viperfish heavily preys on epipelagic migrant species, especially myctophids, and presents spatial and trophic ontogenetic shifts. Temperature restricts its vertical distribution. Therefore, its trophodynamics, migratory behaviour, and functional roles are expected to be modulated by the latitudinal change in temperature. For instance, in most tropical regions the viperfish stay full-time feeding, excreting, and serving as prey (e.g. for bathypelagic predators) at deep layers. On the contrary, in temperate regions, the viperfish ascend to superficial waters where they trophically interact with epipelagic predators and may release carbon where its remineralization is the greatest.

In this article, it is shown that high-energy ball milling can be used to tune the reactivity of nanoflakes. Several nanopowders are synthesized using three different grinding ball diameters (5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm). The powders are characterized in terms of morphology, structure and microstructure. Changing the diameter of the grinding balls results in powders with different characteristics. Among the three diameters used, an optimum is found for powders synthetized with 10 mm diameter balls: they possess the highest specific area, the smallest aluminum crystallites and the lowest amount of deformation. The reactivity of the various nanopowders, evaluated using thermal analysis under air, is shown to be dependent on both textural and microstructural properties of the powders. Such considerations on the microstructural properties of nanopowders are of utmost importance in the quest for the best materials for energetics applications.

Although they are known to live in close association with bacteria in many ecosystems such as biofilms, they are considered to be major bacterial predators in many ecosystems. Little is known on the relationship between protozoa and marine bacteria in microbial communities, more precisely on how bacteria are able survive in environmental niches where these bacterial grazers also live. The objective of this work is to study the interaction between the axenized ubiquitous amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii and four marine bacteria isolated from immersed biofilm, in order to evaluate if they would be all grazed upon by amoeba or if they would be able to survive in the presence of their predator. At a low bacteria-to-amoeba ratio, we show that each bacterium is phagocytized and follows a singular intracellular path within this host cell, which appears to delay or to prevent bacterial digestion. In particular, one of the bacteria was found in the amoeba nucleolar compartment whereas another strain was expelled from the amoeba in vesicles. We then looked at the fate of the bacteria grown in a higher bacteria-to-amoeba ratio, as a preformed mono- or multi-species biofilm in the presence of A. castellanii. We show that all biofilms were subjected to detachment from the surface in the presence of the amoeba or its supernatant. Overall, these results show that bacteria, when facing the same predator, exhibit a variety of escape mechanisms at the cellular and population level, when we could have expected a simple bacterial grazing. Therefore, this study unravels new insights into the survival of environmental bacteria when facing predators that they could encounter in the same microbial communities.

The synthetic fiber was the predominant type of microplastics, accounting for 99.2% of the total items. Blue (59.9%) and white (22.9%) were the most common colors of the fibers. Synthetic fibers showed a homogenous distribution at all sampling sites with a mean concentration of 9238 +/- 2097 items kg(-1) d.w. Meanwhile, the fibers tended to concentrate much more at the surface stratum than the deeper stratum. A large number of synthetic fibers (81.9%) were in the size range of 300-2600 mu m, which might pose a threat to marine biota and human health.

This study investigated bacterial and archaeal community diversity in seawater samples along the Tunisian coast subject to important physicochemical disturbances. The 16S amplicon sequencing survey revealed higher prokaryotic diversity in the northern Tunisian bays than in southeastern waters (Gulf of Gabes). The major taxonomic groups identified in all samples were Alphaproteobacteria (40.9%), Gammaproteobacteria (18.7%), Marine Group II Euryarchaeota (11.3%), and Cyanobacteria (10.9%). Among them, the relative abundance of Alteromonadales, Prochlorococcus, and some clades of Pelagibacterales (SAR11) significantly differed between the northern and the southern bays, whereas no difference was observed across coastal waters in the archaeal Candidatus Poseidoniales (MGII), Synechococcus, and Pelagibacteraceae (SAR11 clade Ia), for which no relationship was observed with the environmental variables. Both Pseudoalteromonas and Alteromonas levels increased with the increasing salinity, density and nutrients (NH4+ and/or PO43-) gradients detected toward the southern waters, while the SAR11 clades Ib and IV and Prochlorococcus, decreased in the shallow, salty and nutrient-rich coastal waters of the Gulf of Gabes. Rhodobacteraceae was positively correlated with Synechococcus and chlorophyll levels, suggesting a relationship with phytoplankton biomass. The present study provides the first insights into planktonic prokaryotic community composition in the South Mediterranean Sea through the analysis of Tunisian seawaters, which may support further investigations on the role of bacterioplankton in the biogeochemistry of these ecosystems.

We find a clear Fukushima (134Cs) signal from the surface to 400 m. The core signal (Cs-134-10 Bq m(-3), 137Cs-12 Bq m(-3)) at 41 degrees-43 degrees N lies at 30-220 m where mode waters formed through deep winter mixing in 2011 outcropped in the western North Pacific. The strongest 2015 152 degrees W Fukushima-source radiocesium signal is associated with Dense-Central Mode Waters consistent with the densest variety of these mode waters being formed off the coast of Japan 4 years earlier. The radionuclide signal transited the basin along subsurface mode water isopycnals mainly on the northern side of the subtropical gyre before outcropping at and to the east of the 152 degrees W line. In 2015, the densest 152 degrees W waters with Cs-134 lie at-435 m in the bottom range of Dense-Central Mode Water at 40 degrees N. There is a weak, but detectable, signal in the boundary current off both Kodiak and Sitka. The deepest detectable Cs-137 (weapon's testing background) are found at and to the north of 45 degrees N at 900-1000 m. With the exception of a single subsurface sample near Hawaii, as of spring 2015, the southernmost Cs-134 was found above 200 mat 30 degrees N. A total date-corrected Cs-134 inventory of 11-16 PBq is estimated. Qualitative comparison to model output suggests good consistency in terms of general location, latitudinal breadth, and predicted depth of penetration, allowing discussion of the bigger picture. However, the model's 2015 152 degrees W radiocesium signal is quantitatively weaker and the core is offset in latitude, potentially due to the lack of consideration of atmospheric deposition.

A Multidimensional Data Acquisition as a Preliminary Step to the Secondary Prevention of the Loss of Autonomy for Patients with Traumatic Injury and Stroke: An AMISIA Pilot Study								IRBM				41	6			316	320		10.1016/j.irbm.2020.06.010			DEC 2020	2020	Background: The aim of our study was to conduct an ad hoc data collection in healthy adults with the intention of extracting individual profiles to study the ability to effectively monitor one's health by extracting relevant indicators. As "each patient is a unique case", AMISIA (Defi CNRS AUTON project) proposes an integrated approach, combining medical health devices, information technology, and human factors to provide patients, health care actors and family caregivers with both the best incentives and a high degree of monitoring. Method: We conducted a data collection experiment in Limoges with 61 participants at the Limoges University. Data were biographic elements, socio-economic profiles, cognitive performance (Corsi test results), a psychological battery (anxiety, fatigue, sleep), posture and gait measurement with 4 Imus and a Wii-balance board, and finally physical activity during a week at home (Armband sensors). Results: For the Corsi virtual walking test, the median memory span for Group A was significantly less (p<0.001) than for Group B. Step count and active energy expenditure were significantly higher in Group B (p<0.05). A multiple regression analysis showed that gender, active energy expenditure, fatigue and tendency to play video games account for 41% of the memory span variance. Conclusion: We have shown that encouraging physical activity can be based on the knowledge of many parameters, such as weight, age, gender and other bio-psycho-social parameters that must also be included in the model.

However, only a few studies have investigated these FA properties in specific environment, such as anthropogenic soils. Therefore, knowledge about FA molecular composition as well as the FA-metal interaction is essential to predict their behavior in the soil. For this reason, the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular composition of FA extracted from two sites in an anthropogenic soil (Terra Mulata), from the Amazon region, as well as their interactions with Cu(II) ions as a model. Results from C-13 NMR, infrared and elemental analysis showed that these FA are composed mostly by alkyl structures and oxygen-functional groups, e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl. The interaction with Cu(II) ions was evaluated by fluorescence quenching, in which the FA showed both high quantity of complexing sites per gram of carbon and good affinity to interact with the metal when compared with other soil FA. The results showed that the complexation capacity was highly correlated by the content of functional groups, while the binding affinity was largely influenced by structural factors. In addition, through the lifetime decay given by time-resolved fluorescence, it was concluded that static quenching took place in FA and Cu(II) interaction with the formation of a non-fluorescent ground-state complex. Therefore, this fraction of soil organic matter will fully participate in complexation reactions, thereby influencing the mobility and bioavailability of metal in soils. Hence, the importance of the study, and the role of FA in the environment, can be seen especially in the Amazon, which is one of the most important biomes in the world.

Lumbar discs are small joints that lie between each two vertebrae (L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1). The segmentation and localization of the different discs are the most important tasks in Computer aided diagnosing of herniation. During the last five years, deep learning based methods have set new standards for many computer vision and pattern recognition research. In this work, our objective is to develop an automatic system based on deep convolutional neural network. This Network processes the input MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in multiple scales of context and then merges the high-level features to enhance the capability of the network to detect discs from lumbar spine. In this study, we are particularly interested in convolutional neural networks (CNN); it was characterized by a topology similar to a visual cortex of mammals. In fact, these kind of techniques has been applied successfully in many classification problems. In order to recognize herniated lumbar disc in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we have chosen to use Convolutional neural networks based on VGG16 architecture. Experiments were carried on our own dataset from Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse. The accuracy achieved of the trained model was 94% which represents a high-performance results by providing state of the art. Our system is very efficient and effective for detecting and diagnosing herniated lumbar disc. Therefore, The contribution of this study includes in: Firstly, the using of the U-net deep neural network architecture to localize and to detail the location of the herniation. Secondly, the using of the axial view MRI in order to locate exactly the pathological and the normal intervertebral discs.The main objective of this paper is to help radiologists in the diagnosing and treating lumbar herniated disc disease.

JEVD problem belongs to the family of joint diagonalization problems. Hence, JEVD algorithms aim at estimating the common basis of eigenvectors of a matrix set. This problem occurs in many signal processing applications. It has notably allowed to develop efficient algorithms for the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of multiway arrays. The proposed JEVD algorithm is based on an original two-step approach. The first step consists in transforming the considered matrix set into a set of positive definite matrices. In this purpose, we introduce an ad hoc joint symmetrization algorithm. This first step allows us to transform the JEVD problem into a simpler orthogonal joint diagonalization problem. The second step is then performed using an efficient orthogonal joint diagonalization algorithm of the literature. Eventually, the performance of the proposed approach is deeply investigated in the CPD context of multidimensional fluorescence data. More particularly, we consider difficult scenarios such as the cases of an overestimated rank and highly correlated factors.

Therefore, we have designed molecularly imprinted polymer films and quaternary ammonium-functionalized- kaolin microparticles to target specifically Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) in wastewaters and ensure a higher purification rate by working in tandem. According to the bacteriological indicators, a reduction by 90 % was registered for GNB (total coliforms and Escherichia coli O157) and by 77 % for GPB (Clostridium perfringens) in wastewaters. The reduction rates were confirmed when using pathogen genetic markers to quantify particular types of GNB and GPB, like Salmonella typhimurium (reduction up to 100 %),Campylobacter jejuni (reduction up to 70 %), Enterococcus faecalis (reduction up to 81 %), Clostridium perfringens (reduction up to 97 %) and Shiga toxinproducing Escherichia coli (reduction up to 64 %). In order to understand the bactericidal activity of prepared films and microparticles, we have performed several key analyses such as Cryo-TEM, to highlight the auto-assembly mechanism of components during the films formation, and Si-29/C-13 CP/MAS NMR, to reveal the way quaternary ammonium groups are grafted on the surface of kaolin microparticles.

This study uses descriptive data analysis, causality, and VAR modeling to verify this hypothesis in the case of COVID-19 in Belgium in relation to people's mobility. The results confirm this women's disadvantage hypothesis, in particular among the working-age population in Belgium. This disadvantage is explained by women's greater mobility during the pandemic. Despite the restrictions on nonessential travel imposed by Belgian authorities, women use public transportation more often than men to travel for work and family reasons and are thus more likely to be exposed to the virus. Therefore, it is necessary that the health, economic, and social response provided by the Belgian authorities correct this inequality.

High Coral Bycatch in Bottom-Set Gillnet Coastal Fisheries Reveals Rich Coral Habitats in Southern Portugal								FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE				7										NOV 13 2020	2020	Bottom-contact fisheries are unquestionably one of the main threats to the ecological integrity and functioning of deep-sea and circalittoral ecosystems, notably cold-water corals (CWC) and coral gardens. Lessons from the destructive impact of bottom trawling highlight the urgent need to understand how fisheries affect these vulnerable marine ecosystems. At the same time, the impact of other fishing gear and small-scale fisheries remains sparsely known despite anecdotal evidence suggesting their impact may be significant. This study aims to provide baseline information on coral bycatch by bottom-set gillnets used by artisanal fisheries in Sagres (Algarve, southwestern Portugal), thereby contributing to understand the impact of the activity but also the diversity and abundance of corals in this region. Coral bycatch frequency and species composition were quantified over two fishing seasons (summer-autumn and spring) for 42 days. The relationship with fishing effort was characterized according to metiers (n = 6). The results showed that 85% of the gillnet deployments caught corals. The maximum number of coral specimens per net was observed in a deployment targeting Lophius budegassa (n = 144). In total, 4,326 coral fragments and colonies of 22 different species were captured (fishing depth range of 57-510 m, mean 139 +/- 8 m). The most affected species were Eunicella verrucosa (32%), Paramuricea grayi (29%), Dendrophyllia cornigera (12%), and Dendrophyllia ramea (6%). The variables found to significantly influence the amount of corals caught were the target species, net length, depth, and mesh size. The 22 species of corals caught as bycatch belong to Orders Alcyonacea (80%), Scleractinia (18%), Zoantharia (1%), and Antipatharia (1%), corresponding to around 13% of the coral species known for the Portuguese mainland coast. These results show that the impact of artisanal fisheries on circalittoral coral gardens and CWC is potentially greater than previously appreciated, which underscores the need for new conservation measures and alternative fishing practices. Measures such as closure of fishing areas, frequent monitoring onboard of fishing vessels, or the development of encounter protocols in national waters are a good course of action. This study highlights the rich coral gardens of Sagres and how artisanal fisheries can pose significant threat to corals habitats in certain areas.

Sampling was conducted in February-March 2012 along a land-ocean continuum, including rivers, groundwater, reef waters, and oceanic waters. Our results indicated the discharges of basalt groundwater (enriched in nitrates) in the southern part of the reef, and the discharges of sand groundwater and river waters (enriched in organic matter) in sites located northward. These discharges mainly impacted fore reef surface waters, while groundwater resurgences were more diffuse and not clearly detected in depth. We highlighted the relationship Si(OH)(4)/NO3- to identify basalt groundwater discharges. We also put forward the relationships humic-like fluorescence/NH4+ and tryptophan-like fluorescence/PO43- to identify sand groundwater discharges and wastewater pollutions, respectively. We observed the eutrophication of the southern part of the reef through higher phytoplankton biomasses, a massive presence of fleshy algal formations and a low coral coverage. The spatial homogeneity of the benthic community structures onto the entire slope contrasted with the spatial heterogeneity of chemical variables in water. This reflected the different spatial and temporal scales involved in biological and chemical processes in coral reef ecosystems.

While temporal and local properties of social networks have been extensively studied, the origin of their dynamical nature is not yet well understood. Networks may grow or shrink if (a) the total population of nodes changes and/or (b) the chance of two nodes being connected varies over time. Here, we develop a method that allows us to classify the source of time-varying nature of temporal networks. In doing so, we first show empirical evidence that real-world dynamical systems could be categorized into two classes, the difference of which is characterized by the way the number of edges grows with the number of active nodes, i.e., densification scaling. We develop a dynamic hidden-variable model to formally characterize the two dynamical classes. The model is fitted to the empirical data to identify whether the origin of scaling comes from a changing population in the system or shifts in the connecting probabilities.

We prove, under Lipschitz assumptions, the convergence of the approximate solutions to the unique solution of the MVSDE. Moreover, we show that the result remains valid, under continuous coefficients, provided that pathwise uniqueness holds. The proof is based on weak convergence techniques and the Skorokhod embedding theorem. In particular, this general result allows us to construct the unique strong solution of a MVSDE by using the Caratheodory numerical scheme. Examples under which pathwise uniqueness holds are given.

Starting from this statement we designed a circuit that has four circuit elements: a linear passive inductor, a linear passive capacitor, a nonlinear resistor and a thermistor, that is, a nonlinear "locally active" memristor. Thus, the purpose of this work was to use a physical memristor, the thermistor, in a Muthuswamy-Chua chaotic system (circuit) instead of memristor emulators. Such circuit has been modeled by a new three-dimensional autonomous dynamical system exhibiting very particular properties such as the transition from torus breakdown to chaos. Then, mathematical analysis and detailed numerical investigations have enabled to establish that such a transition corresponds to the so-called route to Shilnikov spiral chaos but gives rise to a "double spiral attractor".

Existing merging approaches assume that the content of datasets is known and available. However, in several applications, it might be impossible to know the full content of datasets beforehand. This paper investigates several query answering strategies from multiple datasets without knowing their content in advance.

Raw and bentonite calcined at 550 degrees C properties toward metal retention remained in such upper range of efficiency when tested in complex effluents like industrials wastewaters.

Here, we aimed to detect anomalies caused by technical errors in water-quality (turbidity and conductivity) data collected by automated in situ sensors deployed in contrasting riverine and estuarine environments. We first applied a range of artificial neural networks that differed in both learning method and hyperparameter values, then calibrated models using a Bayesian multiobjective optimization procedure, and selected and evaluated the "best" model for each water-quality variable, environment, and anomaly type. We found that semi-supervised classification was better able to detect sudden spikes, sudden shifts, and small sudden spikes, whereas supervised classification had higher accuracy for predicting long-term anomalies associated with drifts and periods of otherwise unexplained high variability.

The topology is comprised of two different length transmission lines (TLs) interconnecting two identical coupled lines (CLs). The S-matrix model is established as a function of the TL and CL parameters. The group delay (GD) at the half wave frequency of the short interconnect TL is derived from the transmission coefficient. To verify the relevance of the proposed turtle circuit theory, a microstrip proof of concept was modeled, designed, simulated, fabricated, and tested. The calculated, simulated and measured results are in good agreement and confirm the turtle prototype bandpass NGD function with approximately 1.97 GHz center frequency and NGD level of approximately x2212;1.3 ns. In addition, this passive circuit operates with very low losses less than x2212;2.5 dB over the reflection coefficient better than x2212;14 dB.

Unlike continental climate rivers, Mediterranean rivers show large discharge variability linked to rainfall, runoff and groundwater discharge, and can be temporary dry. Solid yields are difficult to predict due to variable source of floodwater. This paper assesses the suspended solid discharge of the Las River (SE France), a small stream in karst and urban environments, and its proportion due to flood events. Floods characteristics are analyzed to explore the variability of the solid yield and the influence of urban runoff and karst springs discharge, based on in situ data. The 35 floods events monitored during a 17 months survey largely contributed to the annual yield, with a proportion of 47% of the total water, and 69% of the total solid yielded in 11% of the time. The total rainfall and the total water discharge, related to the water levels in karst springs, drive the total solid yield, mostly composed of mud (90%). Urban runoff induces higher suspended solid concentration than karst flood, but generated a lower total solid yield. Karst springs, by expanding the catchment area of the stream, largely contribute to the total volume of water discharged to the sea and enhance the sand proportion due to their influence on the maximal water discharge. These results reveal the strong influence of the karst spring hydrodynamic functioning on the sediment yield to Mediterranean coastal environments. This study also highlights the efficiency of electric conductivity data to provide valuable insights about floodwater sources and sediment transport processes.

Research question: How can the presence of an upper limb support influence the sitting posture of smartphone users under fixed illumination and brightness? Methods: Twelve subjects (21,6 +/- 5,5 years old) performed web browsing under two environmental positions (POSITION): sitting with and without support (table). The users' postures were evaluated through relative kinematics joint angles analysis. A repeated measure analysis of variance and Tukey post-hoc tests were performed to test the effect of POSITION on posture. Results: In sitting position in front of a table, neck is less stressed (flexion < 10?) and trunk and shoulder are supported which suggests less constrains for the joints. Relevance to industry: To prevent injury or pain, the use of an upper limb support (to lean on) should be considered for people/workers who use the smartphone frequently.

Qualification of a New Differential Calorimeter Configuration Dedicated to Nuclear Heating Rates up to 20 W.g(-1)								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE				67	11			2405	2414		10.1109/TNS.2020.3027913			NOV 2020	2020	The Jules Horowitz Reactor, a new material testing reactor, is currently under construction on the CEA Cadarache site (in the South of France). A nuclear heating rate unequaled in Europe will be provided: 20 W.g(-1) for a nominal thermal power of 100 MW. There is no differential calorimeter in the state of the art that measures such a nuclear heating rate. This article presents a new differential calorimeter configuration dedicated to this very high nuclear heating rate. On the one hand, the chosen configuration is validated and calibrated experimentally under laboratory conditions by using a new heating system, allowing the application of a wide range of electrical power never tested in the literature and ten times higher compared to that commonly used. Then the calorimetric cell response is estimated under real conditions with an analytical model. Finally, 3-D thermal numerical simulations of the whole calorimeter are performed under real conditions. Some parameters, such as the size of the cell, the intercell space, and the nature of the sample, are tuned to propose a very compact differential calorimeter.

Since large data sets are usually stored in nonvolatile memory (NVM), various solutions have been proposed based on emerging memories, such as OxRAM, that rely mainly on area hungry, one transistor (1T) one OxRAM (1R) bit-cell. To tackle this area issue, while keeping the programming control provided by 1T1R bit-cell, we propose to combine gate-allaround stacked junctionless nanowires (1JL) and OxRAM (1R) technology to create a 3-D memory pillar with ultra-high density. Nanowire junctionless transistors have been fabricated, characterized, and simulated to define current conditions for the whole pillar. Finally, based on Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) simulations, we demonstrated successfully scouting logic operations up to three-pillar layers, with one operand per layer.

Fire is one of the main disasters in the world. Nowadays, the forest fire incidences endanger the ecosystem and destroy the native flora and fauna. This affects individual life, community and wildlife. Thus, it is essential to monitor and protect the forests and their assets. Nowadays, image processing outputs a lot of required information and measures for the implementation of advanced forest fire-fighting strategies. This work addresses a new color image segmentation method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and Gabor filter responses. Our method introduces a new superpixels extraction strategy that takes full account of two objectives: regional consistency and robustness to added noises. The novel approach is tested on various color images. Extensive experiments show that our method obviously outperforms existing segmentation variants on real and synthetic images of fire forest scenes, and also achieves outstanding performance on other popular benchmarked images (e.g., BSDS, MRSC). The merits of our proposed approach are that it is not sensitive to added noises and that the segmentation performance is higher with images of nonhomogeneous regions.

In this work, the layer-dependent electronic and optical properties have been studied by varying layer thickness and stacking order. Based on the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, topological analyses on interatomic interactions of layered MX2 and WX2/MoX2, including bond degree (BD), bond length (BL), and bond angle (BA), have been detailed to probe structure-property relationships. Results show that M-X and X-X bonds are strengthened and weakened in layered MX2 compared to the counterparts in bulks. X-X and M-Se/Te are weakened at compressive strain while strengthened at tensile strain and are more responsive to the former than the latter. Discordant BD variation of individual parts of WX2/MoX2 accounts for exclusively distributed electrons and holes, yielding type-II band offsets. X-X BL correlates positively to binding energy (E-b), while X-X BA correlates negatively to lattice mismatch (lm). The resulting interlayer distance limitation evidences constraint-free lattice of vdW structure. Finally, the connection between microscopic interatomic interaction and macroscopic electromagnetic behavior has been quantified firstly by a cubic equation relating to weighted BD summation and static dielectric constant.

A new Thermotoga sp. strain TFO was isolated from an Californian offshore oil reservoir which is phylogenetically related to thermophilic species T. petrophila RKU-1(T) and T. naphthophila RKU-10(T), isolated from the Kubiki oil reservoir in Japan. The average nucleotide identity and DNA-DNA hybridization measures provide evidence that the novel strain TFO is closely related to T. naphthophila RKU-10(T), T. petrophila RKU-1(T) and can not be differentiated at the species level. In the light of these results, the reclassification of T. naphthophila RKU-10 and strain TFO as heterotypic synonyms of T. petrophila is proposed. A pangenomic survey of closely related species revealed 55 TFO strain-specific proteins, many of which being linked to glycosyltransferases and mobile genetic elements such as recombinases, transposases and prophage, which can contribute to genome evolution and plasticity, promoting bacterial diversification and adaptation to environmental changes. The discovery of a TFO-specific transport system dctPQM, encoding a tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter (TRAP), has to be highlighted. The presence of this TRAP system assumes that it could assist in anaerobic n-alkane degradation by addition of fumarate dicarboxylic acid, suggesting a niche-specific gene pool which correlates with the oil reservoir that T. petrophila TFO inhabits. Finally, T. naphthophila RKU-10, T. petrophila RKU-1(T), T. petrophila TFO form a distinct phylogenetic lineage with different geographic origins, share the same type of ecological niche including the burial history of fields. Theses findings might support the indigenous character of this species in oil reservoirs. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Examples have been given in which the effective energy involves the strain-gradient but no general formula provides this strain-gradient dependence. Some formulas have been proposed which involve such terms and provide a small correction to the classical effective energy still when the stiffness of the material varies inside fixed bounds. The goal of this paper is to check the applicability of these formulas for highly contrasted structures. To that aim we focus on structures whose limit energy is already known and we compare the energies given by (i) the convergence results, (ii) the corrective formulas and (iii) by a direct numerical simulation of the complete structure.

The same counterexample is used to disprove a closely related conjecture by Badouel, Darondeau, and Raoult (1999). Using that domains of events structures are CAT(0) cube complexes, we construct our counterexample from an example by Wise (1996, 2007) of a nonpositively curved square complex whose universal cover contains an aperiodic plane. We prove that other counterexamples to Thiagarajan's conjecture arise from aperiodic 4-way deterministic tile sets of Kari and Papasoglu (1999) and Lukkarila (2009). On the positive side, using breakthrough results by Agol (2013) and Haglund and Wise (2008, 2012) from geometric group theory, we prove that Thiagarajan's conjecture holds for strongly hyperbolic regular event structures.

Some local media and public sectors ascribed, without any strong scientific evidence, the origin and reactivation of these blooms to untreated sewage outfalls distributed along the coasts. In order to test whether sewage outfalls could have any influence on the metabolic activity of Trichodesmium, we performed C-13 and N-15(2) uptake experiments with colonies experiencing three different bloom development stages, incubated both with clear seawater and sewage water from an outfall south of Gran Canaria island. Our results showed that sewage outfalls did not promote any increase in dinitrogen (N-2) fixation in Trichodesmium, supporting the hypothesis that decaying blooms were generated offshore and transported shoreward by local currents and winds, accumulating mostly leeward of the islands. The combination of unusually warm seawater temperatures, enhanced and sustained stratification of the upper water column and recurrent dust deposition events would have favored the development of the Trichodesmium blooms, which lasted for at least four months.

We also consider the optimization problem of identifying the minimal upper bound that will permit existence of energy-constrained infinite runs. Our algorithms are based on quantifier elimination for linear real arithmetic. Using Mathematica and Mjollnir, we illustrate our framework through a real industrial example of a hydraulic oil pump.

In 2010, the NAOS (Novel Argo Observing System) project was selected as part of the French "Investissements d'Avenir" Equipex program. The objectives of NAOS were to consolidate the French contribution to Argo's core mission (global temperature and salinity measurements down to 2000 m), and also to develop the future generation of French Argo profiling floats and prepare the next phase of the Argo program with an extension to the deep ocean (Deep Argo), biogeochemistry (BGC-Argo) and polar seas. This paper summarizes how NAOS has met its objectives. The project significantly boosted France's contribution to Argo's core mission by deploying more than 100 NAOS standard Argo profiling floats. In addition, NAOS deployed new-generation floats as part of three scientific experiments: biogeochemical floats in the Mediterranean Sea, biogeochemical floats in the Arctic Ocean, and deep floats with oxygen sensors in the North Atlantic. The experiment in the Mediterranean Sea, launched in 2012, implemented and maintained a network of BGC-Argo floats at basin scale for the first time. The 32 BGC-Argo floats deployed and about 4000 BGC profiles collected have vastly improved characterization of the biogeochemical and ecosystem dynamics of the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, experiments in the Arctic and in the North Atlantic, starting in 2015 and deploying 20 Arctic BGC floats and 23 deep floats, have provided unique observations on biogeochemical cycles in the Arctic and deep-water masses, as well as ocean circulation variability in the North Atlantic.

J	Bontemps, Bastien; Vercruyssen, Fabrice; Gruet, Mathieu; Louis, Julien								Downhill Running: What Are The Effects and How Can We Adapt? A Narrative Review								SPORTS MEDICINE				50	12			2083	2110		10.1007/s40279-020-01355-z			DEC 2020	2020	Downhill running (DR) is a whole-body exercise model that is used to investigate the physiological consequences of eccentric muscle actions and/or exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). In a sporting context, DR sections can be part of running disciplines (off-road and road running) and can accentuate EIMD, leading to a reduction in performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to: (1) better inform on the acute and delayed physiological effects of DR; (2) identify and discuss, using a comprehensive approach, the DR characteristics that affect the physiological responses to DR and their potential interactions; (3) provide the current state of evidence on preventive and in-situ strategies to better adapt to DR. Key findings of this review show that DR may have an impact on exercise performance by altering muscle structure and function due to EIMD. In the majority of studies, EIMD are assessed through isometric maximal voluntary contraction, blood creatine kinase and delayed onset muscle soreness, with DR characteristics (slope, exercise duration, and running speed) acting as the main influencing factors. In previous studies, the median (25th percentile,Q(1); 75th percentile,Q(3)) slope, exercise duration, and running speed were - 12% (- 15%; - 10%), 40 min (30 min; 45 min) and 11.3 km h(-1)(9.8 km h(-1); 12.9 km h(-1)), respectively. Regardless of DR characteristics, people the least accustomed to DR generally experienced the most EIMD. There is growing evidence to suggest that preventive strategies that consist of prior exposure to DR are the most effective to better tolerate DR. The effectiveness of in-situ strategies such as lower limb compression garments and specific footwear remains to be confirmed. Our review finally highlights important discrepancies between studies in the assessment of EIMD, DR protocols and populations, which prevent drawing firm conclusions on factors that most influence the response to DR, and adaptive strategies to DR.

This serves to establish a chronology of the geological events occurring on these different bodies, hence to understand their formation and evolution processes. An approach for dating planetary surfaces relies on the analysis of the impact crater densities with size. Approaches have been proposed to automatically detect impact craters in order to facilitate the dating process. They rely on color values from images or elevation values from Digital Elevation Models (DEM). In this article, we propose a new approach for crater detection, more specifically using their rims. The craters can be characterized by a round shape that can be used as a feature. The developed method is based on an analysis of the DEM geometry, represented as a 3D mesh, followed by curvature analysis. The classification process is done with one layer perceptron. The validation of the method is performed on DEMs of Mars, acquired by a laser altimeter aboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and combined with a database of manually identified craters. The results show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of false negatives compared to others based on topographic information only.

Small changes in wave and tide conditions were found to largely impact circulation patterns. Three main regimes were identified depending on offshore wave obliquity: (1) Under shore-normal configuration, the flow was dominated by cross-shore motions, except for moderate waves at low tide, with the presence of a quasi-steady circulation cell on the reef. (2) Under shadowed configuration, an onshore-directed current flowing away from the headland and a weak oscillating eddy were present outside and inside the shadow region, respectively. (3) Under deflection configuration, a deflection rip flowing against the headland and extending well beyond the surf zone was present, with activity maximized around low tide for moderate waves. Under 4-m oblique waves, the deflection rip was active regardless of the tide with mean depth-averaged velocities up to 0.7m/s 800-m offshore in 12-m depth, with energetic low-frequency fluctuations. Our results emphasize the ability of deflection rips to transport materials far offshore, suggesting that such rips can transport sediment beyond the depth of closure. This study indicates that a wide variety of wave-driven circulation patterns can occur and sometimes coexist on beaches with prominent geological settings. Changes in the dominant driving mechanism can occur as a result of small changes in wave and tide conditions, resulting in more spatially and temporally variable circulation than along open sandy beaches. Plain Language Summary Most field experiments about wave-induced circulation patterns have been conducted along open sandy beaches, while experiments in geologically constrained environments are scarce. We performed intensive field measurements at a high-energy beach with the presence of a 500-m headland and a submerged natural reef. Three main circulation patterns were identified depending on the offshore wave obliquity. For shore-normal waves, cross-shore motions dominated the nearshore region, while oblique wave configurations resulted in more complex horizontal circulation. In particular, under intense headland-directed longshore current, the flow was deflected seaward against the headland. This deflection resulted in an intense seaward flowing jet (deflection rip) extending well beyond the surf zone edge, particularly during storm conditions. Such findings highlight the ability of these deflection rips to dominate water and sediment exchanges between the nearshore and the inner shelf region. Our study further outlines the more spatially and temporally variable circulation patterns occurring along geologically constrained beaches compared to open sandy beaches, ranging from small recirculating cells across the reef to a large deflection rip extending hundreds of meters beyond the surf zone. Key Points In situ measurements are analyzed to identify the main circulation patterns occurring at a high-energy geologically constrained Small changes in offshore wave height and obliquity or tide elevation were found to impact circulation patterns across the entire field This study emphasizes the ability of deflection rips to extend far offshore, particularly during very energetic oblique wave conditions		[Mouragues, Arthur; Bonneton, Philippe; Castelle, Bruno; Marieu, Vincent; Rodriguez-Padilla, Isaac] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5805, EPOC, Pessac, France; [Jak McCarroll, R.; Scott, Tim] Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Coastal Proc Res Grp, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Sous, Damien] Univ Toulon & Var, La Garde, France; [Sous, Damien] Aix Marseille Univ, La Garde, France; [Sous, Damien] CNRS, La Garde, France; [Sous, Damien] IRD, La Garde, France; [Sous, Damien] Mediterranean Inst Oceanog MIO, La Garde, France; [Sous, Damien] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Anglet, France; [Sous, Damien] E2S UPPA, Anglet, France; [Sous, Damien] Chaire HPC WAVES, Anglet, France; [Sous, Damien] SIAME, Anglet, France; [Mouragues, Arthur] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5805, EPOC, Pessac, France								0							Oceanography	WOS:000612077200049

The 3-D Structure of Mesoscale Eddies in the Lofoten Basin of the Norwegian Sea: A Composite Analysis From Altimetry and In Situ Data								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS				125	10					e2020JC016331	10.1029/2020JC016331			OCT 2020	2020	In this research temperature and salinity profiles in eddy-centered coordinates obtained from satellite altimetry (eddy data set distributed by Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data) are combined to document the mean three-dimensional structures of cyclonic (CEs) and anticyclonic (AEs) eddies in the Lofoten Basin. For eddies of both polarities, significant eddy-induced anomalies are concentrated within the zero vorticity radius and vertically to the depth of similar to 900-1,000 m. The thermohaline vertical structures of CEs and AEs differ in terms of salinity and temperature anomalies. Horizontal structure of the mesoscale eddies showed warmer and saltier anomalies for AEs from the southwest to the northeast side, as well as colder and less salty anomalies from their southeast side for the CEs. This reflects the main features of the basin-scale temperature and salinity gradients, strongly affected by the Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current. Mean zonal eddy-induced transport of volume, heat, and salt is generally westward, consistent with the key role played by eddies generated by the Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current. The obtained results highlight the significant role played by mesoscale eddies in the oceanic circulation of the Lofoten Basin, as well as on heat and salt budgets of a key region for air-sea exchanges, water mass transformation, and climate. Plain Language Summary Mesoscale eddies trap water and transport momentum, volume, heat, salt, and biogeochemical constituents from their generation to dissipation sites. Thus, a detailed understanding of mesoscale eddies is crucial to assess dynamic, climatic, and biological processes in the Global Ocean. Here, we investigate three-dimensional structures of mesoscale eddies in the Lofoten Basin (Nordic Seas) by combining the satellite and temperature and salinity data from the multiple platforms (research vessels, autonomous profiling floats, and gliders). We could estimate the heat and salt transport by cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. The results highlight the significant role played by mesoscale eddies in the oceanic circulation of the Lofoten Basin, as well as on heat and salt budgets of this important region for air-sea exchanges, water mass transformation, and climate implications. The obtained three-dimensional structures can also be used as a base for the future estimation of the impact of mesoscale eddies on the biogeochemical processes and environment in the Lofoten Basin region, as well as for validation of high-resolution climate and regional models. Key Points 3-D structures of mesoscale eddies in the Lofoten Basin were revealed by combining the altimetry data and CTD profiles from the multiple platforms Significant eddy-induced anomalies are concentrated within the zero vorticity radius and vertically to the depth of similar to 900-1,000 m Eddy-induced transport is generally westward emerging from the Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current		[Sandalyuk, Nikita V.; Belonenko, Tatyana V.] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Oceanol, St Petersburg, Russia; [Bosse, Anthony] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Bosse, Anthony] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Bosse, Anthony] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD,MIO UM, Marseille, France; [Sandalyuk, Nikita V.] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Oceanol, St Petersburg, Russia								1							Oceanography	WOS:000612077200006		
J	Ettouati, Samuel; Schaffar, Alexandra								Location and residential mobility of foreigners in France								REVUE D ECONOMIE REGIONALE ET URBAINE					4			743	768					OCT 2020	2020	This paper aims to study the location of the immigrant population in France and the determinants of its residential mobility. This work uses a series of different methodological and econometric tools as well as a reconstructed database provided by the National Office of Statistics that measures the share of immigrants in the 304 commuting zones of metropolitan France between 1968 and 2014. This work firstly shows that there is a spatial diffusion of the immigrant population in France between 1968 and 2014. Although the results do not clearly confirm the hypothesis of a demographical convergence of the 304 commuting zones, they show that disparities tend to lessen thanks to the strong residential mobility of immigrants, especially towards the Northern and Western regions. The Paris region remains the area with the highest concentration of immigrants. Secondly, this paper also shows that the residential mobility of immigrants is motivated by the same determinants as the mobility of natives, which are essentially the tensions on the local labor markets and the conditions of the local housing markets. Finally, this work clearly shows that there is neither a general behavior of discrimination of immigrants by natives nor path dependency and community preferences in the location choice of immigrants settled in France, when they undertake residential mobility. This work finally studies the spatial dimension of the residential mobility of immigrants in France over the last forty years.

As this recommendation lacks a high level of evidence, we designed a multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the impact of an Adapted Physical Activity Diet (APAD) education program on fatigue. We randomized 360 women with EBC who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to APAD or usual care at eight French cancer institutions. Data were collected at baseline, end of chemotherapy, end of radiotherapy, and 6 months post-treatment. The primary endpoint was the general cancer-related fatigue score using the MFI-20 questionnaire. Fatigue correlated with the level of precariousness, but we found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of general fatigue (p = 0.274). The APAD arm has a smaller proportion of patients with confirmed depression at the end of follow-up (p = 0.052). A transient modification in physical activity levels and dietary intake was reported in the experimental arm. However, a mixed hospital- and home-based APAD education program is not enough to improve fatigue caused by adjuvant treatment of EBC. Cancer care centers should consider integrating more proactive diet-exercise supportive care in this population, focusing on precarious patients.

These surfaces or mesh models are required to be highly detailed as well as accurate enough, especially for metric applications. Surface generation can be considered as a problem integrated in the complete 3D reconstruction workflow and thus visibility information (pixel similarity and image orientation) is leveraged in the meshing procedure contributing to an optimal photo-consistent mesh. Other methods tackle the problem as an independent and subsequent step, generating a mesh model starting from a dense 3D point cloud or even using depth maps, discarding input image information. Out of the vast number of approaches for 3D surface generation, in this study, we considered three state of the art methods. Experiments were performed on benchmark and proprietary datasets of varying nature, scale, shape, image resolution and network designs. Several evaluation metrics were introduced and considered to present qualitative and quantitative assessment of the results.

To date no efficient vaccine nor antivirals are available for safe human use. During viral replication the nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) catalyzes capping of genomic and subgenomic RNAs. The capping reaction is unique to the Alphavirus genus. The whole three-step process follows a particular order: (i) transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) onto a GTP forming (m7)GTP; (ii) guanylylation of the enzyme to form a (m7)GMP-nsP1adduct; (iii) transfer of m7GMP onto 5 '-diphosphate RNA to yield capped RNA. Specificities of these reactions designate nsP1 as a promising target for antiviral drug development. In the current study we performed a mutational analysis on two nsP1 positions associated with Sindbis virus (SINV) ribavirin resistance in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) context through reverse genetics correlated to enzyme assays using purified recombinant VEEV nsP1 proteins. The results demonstrate that the targeted positions are strongly associated to the regulation of the capping reaction by increasing the affinity between GTP and nsP1. Data also show that in VEEV the S21A substitution, naturally occurring in Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), is a hallmark of ribavirin susceptibility. These findings uncover the specific mechanistic contributions of these residues to nsp1-mediated methyl-transfer and guanylylation reactions.

Experiments performed with A. fulgidus planktonic cells, displayed their capacity to form a biofilm on an iron coupon and exhibited their biocorrosive activity. A. fulgidus was shown to cause indirect corrosion by producing sulfide while oxidizing lactate. Furthermore, the archaeon could grow lithotrophically by using elemental iron as a mineral energy source. Under these latter conditions, A. fulgidus formed chimneys enhancing the direct corrosion process. Moreover, physiological modifications occurred under these conditions notably highlighting the probable use of CO2 instead of sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor to produce acetate similarly to homoacetogens. All together, these results illustrate the metabolic versatility and hence the importance of this hyperthermophilic archaeon in microbial induced corrosion (MIC).

Classically, their dynamics derive from synchronously iterated rules over finite or infinite configurations; however, since for many natural systems to be modelled, asynchrony seems more plausible, asynchronous iteration of the rules has gained a considerable attention in recent years. One question in this context is how changing the update schedule of rule applications affects the global behaviour of the system. In particular, previous works addressed the notion of maximum sensitivity to changes in the update schemes for finite lattices. Here, we extend the notion to infinite lattices, and classify elementary cellular automata space according to such a property. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.		[Ruivo, Eurico L.

Supervised segmentation framework for evaluation of diffusion tensor imaging indices in skeletal muscle								NMR IN BIOMEDICINE				34	1					e4406	10.1002/nbm.4406			JAN 2021	2021	Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is becoming a relevant diagnostic tool to understand muscle disease and map muscle recovery processes following physical activity or after injury. Segmenting all the individual leg muscles, necessary for quantification, is still a time-consuming manual process. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a supervised semi-automatic segmentation pipeline on the quantification of DTI indices in individual upper leg muscles. Longitudinally acquired MRI datasets (baseline, post-marathon and follow-up) of the upper legs of 11 subjects were used in this study. MR datasets consisted of a DTI and Dixon acquisition. Semi-automatic segmentations for the upper leg muscles were performed using a transversal propagation approach developed by Ogier et al on the out-of-phase Dixon images at baseline. These segmentations were longitudinally propagated for the post-marathon and follow-up time points. Manual segmentations were performed on the water image of the Dixon for each of the time points. Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) were calculated to compare the manual and semi-automatic segmentations. Bland-Altman and regression analyses were performed, to evaluate the impact of the two segmentation methods on mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and the third eigenvalue (lambda(3)). The average DSC for all analyzed muscles over all time points was 0.92 +/- 0.01, ranging between 0.48 and 0.99. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the 95% limits of agreement for MD, FA and lambda(3)ranged between 0.5% and 3.0% for the transversal propagation and between 0.7% and 3.0% for the longitudinal propagations. Similarly, regression analysis showed good correlation for MD, FA and lambda(3)(r= 0.99,p< 60; 0.0001). In conclusion, the supervised semi-automatic segmentation framework successfully quantified DTI indices in the upper-leg muscles compared with manual segmentation while only requiring manual input of 30% of the slices, resulting in a threefold reduction in segmentation time.

Effect of surface morphology on the adhesion of silicone elastomers on AA6061 aluminum alloy								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES				102						102656	10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2020.102656			OCT 2020	2020	In this study, different primer formulations were used for enhancing the adhesion between a high consistency methyl phenyl vinyl silicone rubber (HCR) and AA6061 aluminum alloy. These formulations were selected on the basis of their different chemical composition. One contains only silanes and a titanate catalyst, a second contains only reactive macromolecular polysiloxane chains and a third contains both silanes and reactive macromolecular polysiloxane chains as the main components. The effect of the metal surface topography on the efficiency of the primers was investigated. The condensation reactions in the primers were followed by Fourier Transform Infrared Reflexion Absorption (FTIR-RA) spectroscopy and rheological measurements. 90 degrees peel test was used to measure the adhesive strength of the silicone on metal and the fracture surfaces after peeling were analysed using SEM-EDS to determine the loci of failure. Cure monitoring of the silane based formulations showed that hydrolysis/condensation of silanes occur rapidly after their application on AA6061 surfaces and lead to a high degree of crosslinking even in the formulations with PDMS additives. The heat cure of the formulation based on a one-component addition curing system (SiH oligomer, vinylated-PDMS with a platinum catalyst) resulted in a film with a high cohesive strength. The primer formulation containing silanes and reactive PDMSs as the main components resulted in the best adhesion of the silicone elastomer with a dominant cohesive failure. However, a weaker adhesion was obtained at a high roughness of the substrate due to a weak adhesive strength at the metal/primer interface. A pretreatment composed of a first layer of activated silanes and a second layer of reactive silicone chains gave a good adhesion both at low and high roughness of the aluminum substrate. Roughening of the metal surface did not improve the adhesion of silicone elastomers on the primed metals in any of the studied treatments, indicating that mechanical interlocking and increase in contact area do not contribute to adhesion. The results were discussed based on the different chemical composition and rheological properties of the primer formulations.		[Grard, A.; Belec, L.; Perrin, F.

The aim of this work was to assess the consequences of chemical contamination on the coupling between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in two contrasting marine coastal ecosystems: lagoon waters and offshore waters. Bacterial carbon demand was sustained by primary carbon production in the offshore situation, suggesting a tight coupling between both compartments. In contrast, in lagoon waters, due to a higher nutrient and organic matter availability, bacteria could rely on allochthonous carbon sources to sustain their carbon requirements, decreasing so the coupling between both compartments. Exposure to chemical contaminants, pesticides and metal trace elements, resulted in a significant inhibition of the metabolic activities (primary production and bacterial carbon demand) involved in the carbon cycle, especially in offshore waters during spring and fall, inducing a significant decrease of the coupling between primary producers and heterotrophs. This coupling loss was even more evident upon sediment resuspension for both ecosystems due to the important release of nutrients and organic matter. Resulting enrichment alleviated the toxic effects of contaminants as indicated by the stimulation of phytoplankton biomass and carbon production, and modified the composition of the phytoplankton community, impacting so the interactions between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton.

Correlation between structural, magnetic and gas sensor properties of La0.885Pb0.005Ca0.11Fe1-xCoxO2.95(0.00 <= x <= 0.15) compounds								MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN				130						110922	10.1016/j.materresbull.2020.110922			OCT 2020	2020	Ferrite perovskite sensors based on La0.885Pb0.005Ca0.11Fe1-xCoxO2.95( where x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15) were prepared using the sol-gel method. Structural, magnetic and gas sensing properties were investigated. The structural study shows that all samples crystallize in the orthorhombic system in the Pnma space group. Magnetization analysis based on M(T) curves shows the presence of a second order transition from a ferromagnetic (FM) to a paramagnetic (PM) state at the Curie temperature (T-C). T-C decreases from 709 K to 684 K when the percentage of Co increases to 10 %. Introducing cobalt instead of iron causes a decline of the maximum magnetization, which drops from 0.90 with x = 0.00 to 0.01 with x = 0.15. In addition, we find that an increase in Co content induces a decrease in the volume and porosity of the compounds. Increasing the concentration of Co thus decreases sensor sensitivity with respect to the gas to be detected, which in this study is ammonia, NH3. The normalized electrical sensor response decreases from 1.027 to 1.014 respectively for Co concentrations of x = 0.00 (undoped sample) and x = 0.05 with an exposure of 10 ppm of ammonia at 270 degrees C. We show that La0.885Pb0.005Ca0.11Fe1-xCoxO2.95 (0.00 <= x <= 0.15) -based compounds can be considered as potential candidates for ammonia detection and that in fact they are able to detect NH3 concentrations of around 10 ppm.

One property of the substance concerns the metal complexation and interaction with organic contaminants. In this sense, the humic substances (HS), a heterogeneous mixture of compounds, naturally derived from degradation of biomass, have been widely studied in environmental sciences. Recent advances showed a new way to produce humic-like substances (HLS) through hydrothermal carbonization of biomass. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the HLS of hydrochars, produced by using a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and vinasse with sulfuric acid added (1 and 4% v/v), and to assess their interactions with metal ions, (Fe(III), Al(III), Cu(II) and Co(II)) using EEM-PARAFAC and a two-dimensional FTIR correlation analysis. The results were compared to the humic substances extracted from the Amazonian Anthrosol, as a model of anthropogenic organic matter. NMR analysis showed that humic-like extracts from hydrochar are mainly hydrophobic, while the soil has a greater contribution of polar moieties. The HLS and HS showed similar complexation capacities for Fe(III), Al(III) and Cu(II) assays. For Co(II) HLS exhibited larger affinities than HS. Two-dimensional correlation analysis FTIR showed that chemical groups may undergo conformational alteration with metal additions to achieve more stable arrangements (higher stability constant). Therefore, these results contribute more knowledge about the mechanism of HS and metal ion interaction, as well as showing that HTC can be an interesting option for HLS production, to be used as humic based materials.

The objective is to generate an optimized trajectory in the joint space, taking into account axis redundancy for parts of revolution produced with a coaxial deposition system. To achieve this goal, a new layer-by-layer method coupled with a trajectory constrained optimization is presented. The optimization results are theoretically compared to a non-optimized trajectory and a point-by-point optimized trajectory. The layer-by-layer generation of optimized trajectories is validated experimentally on a 6-axis robot using a PLA extrusion system. Experimental results show that the layer-by-layer trajectory optimization strategy applied to parts of revolution provides better geometrical accuracy while improving the efficiency of the manufacturing device compared to non-optimized solutions.

We demonstrated that hydrogen production from intestinal fermentation could exacerbate DCS in rats fed with a standard diet. The aim of this study is to identify a fecal metabolomic signature that may result from the effects of a provocative hyperbaric exposure. The fecal metabolome was studied in two groups of rats previously fed with maize or soy in order to account for diet effects. 64 animals, weighing 379.0_20.2 g on the day of the dive, were exposed to the hyperbaric protocol. The rats were separated into two groups: 32 fed with maize (Div MAIZE) and 32 fed with soy (Div SOY). Gut fermentation before the dive was estimated by measuring exhaled hydrogen. Following hyperbaric exposure, we assessed for signs of DCS. Blood was analyzed to assay inflammatory cytokines. Conventional and ChemRICH approaches helped the metabolomic interpretation of the cecal content. The effect of the diet is very marked at the metabolomic level, a little less in the blood tests, without this appearing strictly in the clinic status. Nevertheless, 37 of the 184 metabolites analyzed are linked to clinical status. 35 over-expressed compounds let suggest less intestinal absorption, possibly accompanied by an alteration of the gut microbial community, in DCS. The decrease in another metabolite suggests hepatic impairment. This spectral difference of the ceca metabolomes deserves to be studied in order to check if it corresponds to functional microbial particularities.

Similarly, routing labeling schemes label the vertices of a graph in a such a way that given the labels of a source node and a destination node, it is possible to compute efficiently the port number of the edge from the source that heads in the direction of the destination. One of important problems is finding natural classes of graphs admitting distance and/or routing labeling schemes with labels of polylogarithmic size.

This study investigated central fatigue kinetics in the knee extensors during a low-intensity sustained isometric contraction. Eleven subjects sustained a 10% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) until task failure (TF) with neuromuscular evaluation every 3 minutes. Testing encompassed transcranial magnetic stimulation to evaluate maximal voluntary activation (VA(TMS)), motor evoked potential (MEP), and silent period (SP), and peripheral nerve stimulation to assess M-wave. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was also recorded. MVC progressively decreased up to 50% of the time to TF (ie, 50%(TTF)) and then plateaued, reaching similar to 50% at TF (P < .001). VA(TMS)progressively decreased up to 90%(TTF)and then plateaued, the decrease reaching similar to 20% at TF (P < .001). SP was lengthened early (ie, from 20%(TTF)) during the exercise and then plateaued (P < .01). No changes were reported for MEP evoked during MVC (P = .87), while MEP evoked during submaximal contractions decreased early (ie, from 20%(TTF)) during the exercise and then plateaued (P < .01). RPE increased linearly during the exercise to be almost maximal at TF. M-waves were not altered (P = .88). These findings confirm that TF is due to the subjects reaching their maximal perceived effort rather than any particular central event or neuromuscular limitations since MVC at TF was far from 10% of its original value. It is suggested that strategies minimizing RPE (eg, motivational self-talk) should be employed to enhance endurance performance.

This low-nutrient low-chlorophyll region is characterised by a long stratification period (May-November) during which surface waters are depleted of macronutrients. Trace metals exhibit a range of biogeochemical behaviours from surface-enriched (scavenged-type) to surface-depleted (nutrient-like) with Co and Ni as representative cases. Cobalt (28-172 pM) distributions are governed by external inputs of aeolian dust deposition and removal by adsorption onto particles in surface, intermediate and deep waters as well. Nickel (3.57-5.52 nM) distributions are governed by internal biogeochemical cycles, together with physical mixing and circulation patterns. Nickel is primarily removed from surface waters with biogenic particles and then remineralised at depth. Copper (1.39-2.89 nM) distributions illustrate a mixture of the two typical behaviours mentioned above. Distributions of typically anthropogenic and particle-reactive Pb (82-235 pM) are in agreement with a Mediterranean flow source of Pb for the adjacent North Atlantic Ocean. The mechanisms controlling the biogeochemical cycling of TMs, such as atmospheric inputs, physical forcing, and interactions with primary production, are discussed according to the TM physico-chemical properties and biological importance.

This work reports, for the first time, the interfacial crystallization of a miscible blend between polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) with milkweed fibers. We have first described the morphology of the fibers and the chemical composition of waxes covered on its surface. Our findings show that the transcrystallization (TC) layer of PCL/PVC could appear at the interface by simply coating with a layer of graphene oxide (GO) on the milkweed fiber. In our study, atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy analysis shows that the crystallinity of the blends is higher at the vicinity of the interface compared to that in the bulk. The kinetic of the interfacial crystallization in terms of spherulite morphology and crystal growth rates at the nanoscale is examined. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze the prepared GO and evaluate its relationship with the interfacial crystallization behavior of the blends.

J	Magueijo, Joao; Zlosnik, Tom; Speziale, Simone								Quantum cosmology of a dynamical Lambda								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				102	6					064006	10.1103/PhysRevD.102.064006			SEP 8 2020	2020	By allowing torsion into the gravitational dynamics one can promote the cosmological constant Lambda to a dynamical variable in a class of quasitopological theories. In this paper we perform a minisuperspace quantization of these theories in the connection representation. If Lambda is kept fixed, the solution is a delta-normalizable version of the Chern-Simons (CS) state, which is the dual of the Hartle and Hawking and Vilenkin wave functions. We find that the CS state solves the Wheeler-De Witt equation also if Lambda is rendered dynamical by an Euler quasitopological invariant, in the parity-even branch of the theory. In the absence of an infrared (IR) cutoff, the CS state suggests the marginal probability P(Lambda) = delta(Lambda). Should there be an IR cutoff (for whatever reason), the probability is sharply peaked at the cut off. In the parity-odd branch, however, we can still find the CS state as a particular (but not most general) solution, but further work is needed to sharpen the predictions. For the theory based on the Pontryagin invariant (which only has a parity-odd branch) the CS wave function no longer is a solution to the constraints. We find the most general solution in this case, which again leaves room for a range of predictions for Lambda.

Although microplastics and their effects have been investigated in this area, most of the currently available studies have been limited to the northwestern part of the basin. This study constitutes a first attempt to determine the abundance, characteristics and composition of microplastics in near surface waters of the Gulf of Gabes (southern Mediterranean Sea, Tunisia). Samples were collected using a 200 mu m-mesh size trawl net along two transects. The study revealed an average concentration of 63,739 items/km(2) where fragments and films were the most frequent microplastics. Polyethylene, reformulated polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant plastics identified among the samples (86-100%). The influence of hydrodynamics on microplastics in the Gulf of Gabes was investigated through the use of a Lagrangian tracking model to simulate the dispersion of particles in water. Modelling results seem to be in agreement with the reported distribution and characteristics of microplastics in this area.

The class of regular word functions has recently emerged as an important class of word-to-word functions, characterized by means of (functional, or unambiguous, or deterministic) two-way transducers, copyless streaming string transducers, and MSO-definable graph transformations. A fundamental result in language theory is Kleene's Theorem, relating finite state automata and regular expressions. Recently, a set of regular function expressions has been introduced and used to prove a similar result for regular word functions, by showing its equivalence with copyless streaming string transducers. In this paper, we propose a direct, simplified and effective translation from unambiguous two-way transducers to regular function expressions extending the Brzozowski and McCluskey algorithm. In addition, our approach allows us to derive a subset of regular function expressions characterizing the (strict) subclass of functional sweeping transducers.

We used nanopore technology to generate chromosome-level assemblies for 3 different strains of Drechmeria coniospora, a nematophagous fungus used extensively in the study of innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Results: One natural geographical isolate demonstrated high stability over decades, whereas a second isolate not only had a profoundly altered genome structure but exhibited extensive instability. We conducted an in-depth analysis of sequence errors within the 3 genomes and established that even with state-of-the-art tools, nanopore methods alone are insufficient to generate eukaryotic genome sequences of sufficient accuracy to merit inclusion in public databases. Conclusions: Although nanopore long-read sequencing is not accurate enough to produce publishable eukaryotic genomes, in our case, it has revealed new information about genome plasticity in D. coniospora and provided a backbone that will permit future detailed study to characterize gene evolution in this important model fungal pathogen.

J	Kaabi, Rabeb; Bouchouicha, Moez; Mouelhi, Aymen; Sayadi, Mounir; Moreau, Eric								An Efficient Smoke Detection Algorithm Based on Deep Belief Network Classifier Using Energy and Intensity Features								ELECTRONICS				9	9					1390	10.3390/electronics9091390			SEP 2020	2020	Smoke detection plays an important role in forest safety warning systems and fire prevention. Complicated changes in the shape, texture, and color of smoke remain a substantial challenge to identify smoke in a given image. In this paper, a new algorithm using the deep belief network (DBN) is designed for smoke detection. Unlike popular deep convolutional networks (e.g., Alex-Net, VGG-Net, Res-Net, Dense-Net, and the denoising convolution neural network (DNCNN), specifically devoted to detecting smoke), our proposed end-to-end network is mainly based on DBN. Indeed, most traditional smoke detection algorithms follow the pattern recognition process which consists basically feature extraction and classification. After extracting the candidate regions, the main idea is to perform both smoke recognition and smoke-no-smoke region classification using static and dynamic smoke characteristics. However, manual smoke detection cannot meet the requirements of a high smoke detection rate and has a long processing time. The convolutional neural network (CNN)-based smoke detection methods are significantly slower due to the maxpooling operation. In addition, the training phase can take a lot of time if the computer is not equipped with a powerful graphics processing unit (GPU). Thus, the contribution of this work is the development of a preprocessing step including a new combination of features-smoke color, smoke motion, and energy-to extract the regions of interest which are inserted within a simple architecture with the deep belief network (DBN). Our proposed method is able to classify and localize reliably the smoke regions providing an interesting computation time and improved performance metrics. First, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed to capture the frames containing a large amount of motion. After applying RGB rules to smoke pixels and analyzing the energy attitude of smoke regions, extracted features are then used to feed a DBN for classification. Experimental results conducted on the publicly available smoke detection database confirm that the DBN has reached a high detection rate that exceeded an average of 96% when tested on different videos containing smoke-like objects, which make smoke recognition more challenging. The proposed methodology provided high detection ratios and low false alarms, and guaranteed robustness verified by evaluations of accuracy, F1-score, and recall for noisy and non-noisy images with and without noise.

A novel method is proposed in this paper to provide robust measurement of torsional eye movements. A numerical approach is presented to estimate the iris boundary only according to the gaze direction, so the segmentation of the iris is more robust against occlusions and ambiguities. The perspective distortion of the iris pattern at eccentric eye positions is also corrected, benefiting from the transformation relation that is established for the iris estimation. The angle of the eye torsion is next measured on the unrolled iris patterns via a TM (Template Matching) technique. The principle of the proposed method is validated and its robustness in practice is assessed. A very low mean FPR (False Positive Rate) is reported (i.e., 3.3%) in a gaze test when testing on five participants with very different eye morphologies. The present method always gave correct measurement on the iris patterns with simulated eye torsions and rarely provided mistaken detections in the absence of eye torsion in practical conditions. Therefore, it shows a good potential to be further applied in medical applications.

Quantum dots grown on a (311)A-oriented surface are obtained with record surface density, with or without a wetting layer. These are appealing features for quantum dot lasing, thanks to the large density of quantum emitters and a truly 3D lateral confinement. However, the intimate photophysics of this class of nanostructures has not yet been investigated. Here, we address the main optical and electronic properties of s-shell excitons in individual quantum dots grown on (311)A substrates with photoluminescence spectroscopy experiments. We show the presence of neutral exciton and biexciton as well as positive and negative charged excitons. We investigate the origins of spectral broadening, identifying them in spectral diffusion at low temperature and phonon interaction at higher temperature, the presence of fine interactions between electron and hole spin, and a relevant heavy-hole/light-hole mixing. We interpret the level filling with a simple Poissonian model reproducing the power excitation dependence of the s-shell excitons. These results are relevant for the further improvement of this class of quantum emitters and their exploitation as single-photon sources for low-density samples as well as for efficient lasers for high-density samples.

Shallow populations ofP. clavatain the North-Western Mediterranean are severely affected by warming-induced mass mortality events (MMEs). These MMEs have differentially impacted individuals and populations ofP. clavata(i.e., varied levels of tissue necrosis and mortality rates) over thousands of kilometers of coastal areas. The eco-evolutionary processes, including genetic factors, contributing to these differential responses remain to be characterized. Here, we sequenced aP. clavataindividual with short and long read technologies, producing 169.98 Gb of Illumina paired-end and 3.55 Gb of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads. We obtained ade novogenome assembly accounting for 607 Mb in 64,145 scaffolds. The contig and scaffold N50s are 19.15 Kb and 23.92 Kb, respectively. Despite of the low contiguity of the assembly, its gene completeness is relatively high, including 75.8% complete and 9.4% fragmented genes out of the 978 metazoan genes contained in the metazoa_odb9 database. A total of 62,652 protein-coding genes have been annotated. This assembly is one of the few octocoral genomes currently available. This is undoubtedly a valuable resource for characterizing the genetic bases of the differential responses to thermal stress and for the identification of thermo-resistant individuals and populations. Overall, having the genome ofP. clavatawill facilitate studies of various aspects of its evolutionary ecology and elaboration of effective conservation plans such as active restoration to overcome the threats of global change.

Here, we describe the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of cell assemblies through temporal network formalism. We use a sliding window approach to extract sequences of networks of information sharing among single units in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during anesthesia and study how global and node-wise functional connectivity properties evolve through time and as a function of changing global brain state (theta vs. slow-wave oscillations). First, we find that information sharing networks display, at any time, a core-periphery structure in which an integrated core of more tightly functionally interconnected units links to more loosely connected network leaves. However the units participating to the core or to the periphery substantially change across time windows, with units entering and leaving the core in a smooth way. Second, we find that discrete network states can be defined on top of this continuously ongoing liquid core-periphery reorganization. Switching between network states results in a more abrupt modification of the units belonging to the core and is only loosely linked to transitions between global oscillatory states. Third, we characterize different styles of temporal connectivity that cells can exhibit within each state of the sharing network. While inhibitory cells tend to be central, we show that, otherwise, anatomical localization only poorly influences the patterns of temporal connectivity of the different cells. Furthermore, cells can change temporal connectivity style when the network changes state. Altogether, these findings reveal that the sharing of information mediated by the intrinsic dynamics of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex cell assemblies have a rich spatiotemporal structure, which could not have been identified by more conventional time- or state-averaged analyses of functional connectivity. Author Summary It is generally thought that computations performed by local brain circuits rely on complex neural processes, associated with the flexible waxing and waning of cell assemblies, that is, an ensemble of cells firing in tight synchrony. Although cell assembly formation is inherently and unavoidably dynamical, it is still common to find studies in which essentially "static" approaches are used to characterize this process. In the present study, we adopt instead a temporal network approach. Avoiding usual time-averaging procedures, we reveal that hub neurons are not hardwired but that cells vary smoothly their degree of integration within the assembly core. Furthermore, our temporal network framework enables the definition of alternative possible styles of "hubness." Some cells may share information with a multitude of other units but only in an intermittent manner, as "activists" in a flash mob. In contrast, some other cells may share information in a steadier manner, as resolute "lobbyists." Finally, by avoiding averages over preimposed states, we show that within each global oscillatory state rich switching dynamics can take place between a repertoire of many available network states. We thus show that the temporal network framework provides a natural and effective language to rigorously describe the rich spatiotemporal patterns of information sharing instantiated by cell assembly evolution.

J	Oliveri, Roberto; Speziale, Simone								Boundary effects in General Relativity with tetrad variables								GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION				52	8					83	10.1007/s10714-020-02733-8			SEP 1 2020	2020	Varying the gravitational Lagrangian produces a boundary contribution that has various physical applications. It determines the right boundary terms to be added to the action once boundary conditions are specified, and defines the symplectic structure of covariant phase space methods. We study general boundary variations using tetrads instead of the metric. This choice streamlines many calculations, especially in the case of null hypersurfaces with arbitrary coordinates, where we show that the spin-1 momentum coincides with the rotational 1-form of isolated horizons. The additional gauge symmetry of internal Lorentz transformations leaves however an imprint: the boundary variation differs from the metric one by an exact 3-form. On the one hand, this difference helps in the variational principle: gluing hypersurfaces to determine the action boundary terms for given boundary conditions is simpler, including the most general case of non-orthogonal corners. On the other hand, it affects the construction of Hamiltonian surface charges with covariant phase space methods, which end up being generically different from the metric ones, in both first and second-order formalisms. This situation is treated in the literature gauge-fixing the tetrad to be adapted to the hypersurface or introducing a fine-tuned internal Lorentz transformation depending non-linearly on the fields. We point out and explore the alternative approach of dressing the bare symplectic potential to recover the value of all metric charges, and not just for isometries. Surface charges can also be constructed using a cohomological prescription: in this case we find that the exact 3-form mismatch plays no role, and tetrad and metric charges are equal. This prescription leads however to different charges whether one uses a first-order or second-order Lagrangian, and only for isometries one recovers the same charges.

The effectiveness of these AOPs as powerful way for the removal of POPs is related to the in situ production of strong oxidative species such as the hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Among the techniques involving AOPs, photo-electrocatalysis (PEC) has come out as a powerful AOP consisting of the combination of both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes for the objective to retard and/or avoid the fast recombination of the formed electron/hole pairs during the PEC. This can be achieved by the extraction of the photogenerated electrons directed to the cathode when an external bias potential is applied to the photoanode. This general and critical review deals with the application of PEC to the remediation of organic pollutants from wastewaters (i.e. dyeing effluents) using phosphate-based photoanodes namely BiPO4, Ag3PO4, Cu-2(OH)PO(4)and others. A detailed description of the PEC power of different photoanode has been discussed. The fundamentals and main applications of photo-electrochemical oxidation are reported. Finally, some critiques are proposed in order to improve and develop new effective photoanodes with perspectives to industrial applications.

In the measured spectra, we clearly observe spectral fluctuations, with slight shifts in wavenumber, appearance, and disappearance of peaks and variations in the shape of some peaks. By comparison with spectra simulated by density functional theory, we attribute those fluctuations to the experimental signature of various adsorption sites of the molecule on the gold surface. The effect of temperature and laser power was also studied, suggesting that changes in absorption sites can be optically activated. Such features could cause misinterpretation of SERS spectra and errors in the identification of drugs. We suggest that they should be systematically considered for the correct interpretation of SERS spectra of drug molecules.

However, the amount of water stored in these areas and its contribution to aquifer recharge is unknown. This study aimed to quantify the amount of water that can be retained in a natural wetland and to propose a model of groundwater recharge. We used remote sensing techniques involving unmanned aerial vehicle to map the wetland and highlight its internal morphology, using a red-green-blue orthomosaic and a digital surface model. The 2-D inversion and a pseudo-3-D model from electrical resistivity tomography data were used to visualize the subsurface structures and hydrologic flow paths. The wetland is a reservoir storing up to 416.996 m(3) of water during the rainy months. Distinct internal compartments characterize the wetland topography and different water-volume storage, lower in the border and higher in the center. A leakage point connects surface water to groundwater through direct vertical flow, which constitutes the aquifer recharge zone. Remotely sensed very high-resolution images allied with geophysical techniques allowed complete surface and subsurface imaging and offered visual tools that contributed to understanding the hydrodynamics of the wetland.

We apply this result in different contexts including recovery of some general class of non-compactly supported coefficients from measurements on a bounded subset and recovery of an electric potential, supported on an unbounded cylinder, of a Schrodinger operator in a slab.

However, the increase of new carbon inputs to soil has the potential to trigger the mineralization of stabilized SOM, a process called priming effect. The objective of this manuscript is to investigate, at a landscape scale (5 km(2)), the factors influencing the susceptibility of SOM to priming effect. To achieve this objective, physical, chemical, and metagenomics analyses were conducted on 88 soil samples and successively combined with agronomical data and soil incubation for the quantification of carbon fluxes. Variance partitioning models highlighted that priming effect is controlled by complex interactions of biotic and abiotic factors, which include soil chemistry, quality of SOM, shape and abundance of microbial communities. Fluorescence properties of the dissolved organic matter has been found as a strong descriptor for priming effect. Depending on the time of crop rotation devoted to grassland, two different components leading to priming effect were identified. The introduction of grassland for 40-60% of the time of rotation achieved the lowest susceptibility to priming effect, and higher indexes of microbial diversity, whereas higher or lower proportions of time of the rotation devoted to grassland resulted in an increase of priming effect and a decrease of bacterial evenness.

This LSPR depends on the near field antenna, its material and shape, and the surrounding medium with respect to its relative permittivity and the volume fraction of the optical near field occupied by the sample. Here, we investigate the effects of the surface composition and topography on the change of the LSPR intensity in tip-enhanced spectroscopy on SrTiO3 nanoislands by monitoring the LSPR enhanced luminescence of gold tips. Our experimental results and analytical estimates indicate that by affecting the effective permittivity of the dielectric environment at the tip apex, the material composition as well as topography of the studied sample induce a change in LSPR intensity. This result significantly helps the understanding of the evolution or origin of the LSPR intensity during a typical TERS measurement, which in turn leads to a more accurate assessment of the relative intensity of different Raman modes in TERS.

In this context, the main task worldwide, texting, is performed under a wide range of light and position conditions. The aim of this study was to test the effects of environmental illumination and screen brightness settings on upper limb and axial skeleton parameters. Twelve subjects performed three trials of texting under three experimental positions, two screen luminance settings and three environmental light conditions. 3 D axial skeleton and upper limb angles, smartphone orientation and face-to-smartphone distance were used as dependent variables. High environmental illumination and/or low screen brightness resulted in an increase in interaction time and a reduction in the face-to-smartphone distance by approximately 10%. Subjects attempted to compensate for the unfavourable effects of such light conditions by adopting postures rated 5 in the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment, indicating an increased risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders. Practitioner's summary:The purpose of the study was to quantify the joint angles of the upper body in experimental conditions that represent daily life. Postures were influenced by ambient illumination and display brightness. The most harmful postures were observed when the display brightness was minimum, and the ambient light was similar to a sunny day.

Across the Mediterranean Sea, this toxic microalga has been shown to thrive on the surface of various species of macroalgae, including Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyceae. Interestingly, some Dictyotaceae are characterized by a low abundance of cells of O. cf. ovata on their surface. Based on the antifouling properties of some specialized metabolites produced by seaweeds, macroalgal metabolites have been proposed to contribute to the settlement and development of O. cf. ovata. To address this question, the composition of the surface of four Dictyotaceae, Dictyota dichotoma, Dictyota spiralis, Taonia atomaria, and Padina pavonica was investigated through an integrative approach combining the analysis of their eukaryotic diversity (18S rRNA gene metabarcoding), their surface metabolome (untargeted LC -MS-based metabolomics) as well as the bioactivity of their surface extracts on O. cf. ovata. Altogether, the data suggest an influence of the macroalgal surface chemistry on the growth of the dinoflagellate, with D. dichotoma being the most bioactive. Some metabolites are proposed to be involved in the observed bioactivity. Other biotic factors are also likely to be entailed in the control of the O. cf. ovata population and they may even prevail on the influence of the macroalgal surface chemistry.

However, the cycling of trace metals in mangroves is complex due to various biogeochemical processes across the intertidal zone, notably the dissolution of bearing phases resulting in high trace metal concentrations in porewaters. Previous studies demonstrated a decrease of trace metal stocks in mangrove soils seaward, possibly due to the export of dissolved metals through tidal pumping. Can Gio mangrove is the largest one in Vietnam, developing downstream Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam's biggest industrial city). The objectives of the present study were to characterize the dynamics of trace metals in a tidal creek of the Can Gio mangrove that does not receive any upstream inputs and to identify the role of porewater seepage on their dynamics. To reach our goals, surface water and suspended particulate matters were collected every 2 h during two different tidal cycles (spring and neap tides) and at the two different seasons, dry and wet. Mangroves porewaters were also collected. In addition to particulate and dissolved trace metals, physico-chemical parameters and a groundwater tracer (Radon -Rn-222) were measured. The results showed that trace metal concentrations at flood tides, both in the dissolved and the particulate phases, were in the same range that those measured in the Can Gio Estuary. Then during ebb tides, we evidenced high inputs of dissolved Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni from mangrove soils. However, the dynamics of these inputs differed depending on the element considered. Mn was exported from the tidal creek in its dissolved form. However concerning Fe, and to a lesser extent Co and Ni, we suggest that, when delivered to the creek from the soils under dissolved forms, these trace metals precipitated because of different physicochemical characteristics between mangrove soils and tidal creek, notably higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and higher pH. Consequently, these elements were exported to the estuary in particulate forms. We suggest that budget studies of trace metals in mangroves should be developed like the ones concerning carbon to efficiently determine their role as a barrier for pollutants between land and sea.

We studied the interactions betweenPDMPOand water-dissolved Si, Al and natural organic matter (humic acids, HA). Six systems with different HA, Si and Al concentrations were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy at pH 4, 7 and 9. The Al-PDMPOcomplex was characterized by infrared spectroscopy and the particle size distribution in solution was characterized by nano tracking analysis. We found that when usual pH buffers are not present, thePDMPOfluorescence was not pH dependent and was not Si-specific. In thePDMPO-Si-HA system, thePDMPOfluorescence signals were greatly enhanced, suggesting the formation of highly fluorescent ternary HA-PDMPO-Si groups. When Al was added to the system, the fluorescence was strongly quenched, suggesting the formation of low-fluorescence quaternary HA-PDMPO-Si-Al groups. ThePDMPOfluorescence is therefore greatly sensitive to complexable metals and to natural organic matter and is therefore difficult to be applied for the quantification of Si or pH in a complex medium.

If formal verification, and especially model-checking, is a popular method for proving the correctness of properties, its efficiency depends on the accuracy of the used models and the quality of abstractions. As a consequence, applying verification techniques on large-scale complex software like video games is hard without strong assumptions and simplifications. Simulation models are generally more accurate than verification models, but it is often harder to verify them. Combined formalisms that take the benefits of both model-checking and discrete-event simulation represent a good deal between both of these families, although strong engineering expertise remains necessary to define the relevant tests and scenarios. This paper proposes an approach to build this kind of formalism through the example of DEv-PROMELA, which is built by combining Discrete-event System Specification formalism and PROMELA language. Then, it shows how combined formalisms can be used for modeling, verifying, and validating complex software like video games by using both formal-based and simulation-based verification and validation.

However, during the synthesis of this chromophore, a cycloadduct compound confirmed by X-ray structure was obtained by an intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. The retro cycloaddition reaction carried out in thermal conditions and followed by UV-Visible absorption spectrophotometry afforded quantitively the target chromophore. Electrochemical properties recorded are in good agreement with open and close compounds. Mechanism involves cis/trans isomerization was proposed to explain the complete conversion.

The single-phase character of the samples has been checked by X-ray diffraction. The standard enthalpies of formation of the Cs2MonO3n+1 polymolybdates with n = 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 have been measured by solution calorimetry in dilute (CsOH center dot H2O) solvent at 298.15 K under 0.1 MPa. The values found for the mono and dimolybdates, Delta H-f degrees (Cs2MoO4) = -1513.56 +/- 1.11 kJ mol(-1), Delta H-f degrees (Cs2Mo2O7) = -2301.84 +/- 2.37 kJ mol(-1), are in good agreement with the already available calorimetric measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the enthalpies of formation of cesium tri, penta, and heptamolybdates are measured: Delta H-f degrees (Cs2Mo3O10) = -3077.17 +/- 3.47 kJ mol(-1), Delta H-f degrees (Cs2Mo5O16) = -4601.70 +/- 5.96 kJ mol(-1), and Delta H-f degrees (Cs2Mo7O22) = -6087.16 +/- 8.79 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The convex shape of the curve constructed from the formation enthalpies of the Cs2MonO3n+1 polymolybdates referred to the Cs2MoO4 and MoO3 oxides is consistent with the Cs2MoO4-MoO3 pseudobinary diagram.

The bandpass NGD theory is elaborated with patch antenna-based circuit input impedance. The S-matrix and group delay (GD) models are expressed in function of the circuit geometrical parameters. To validate the no-contact electromagnetic coupling bandpass NGD control, proof of concept is designed, fabricated and tested. The bandpass NGD behavior is in good agreement between theoretical model, EM full wave simulation and measurement, which shows NGD center frequency, 2.2 GHz, value, -0.67 ns and insertion loss, -2.93 dB, and reflection loss, -11.39 dB. It is also demonstrated that the NGD parameters vary in function of the metallic sheet-patch distance increased progressively from 0 to 26 cm.

Results indicate strong influence of the seawater exchange and circulation, on the organic matter accumulation inside the lagoon, visible through a significant correlation between TOC and salinity in both seasons. Two times higher concentration of TOC (up to 5.5 mg/l) was recorded in autumn, when high salinity water (46 ps mu) was present in the lagoon. POC made a relatively small percentage of TOC in autumn samples when high accumulation of TOC, especially its DOC fraction can be related to remineralization processes and zooplankton-mediated release of DOC. Indeed, PCA analysis identified DOC as the most significant factor influencing the observed variability in autumn samples, and correlated to NH4+ thorn (p < 0.05) in surface waters, while POC was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to chlorophyll a. During spring, organic matter in the lagoon was depth-dependent and under the high influence of salinity and temperature, and in the surface correlated to NO3-. Satellite data on lagoon water optical properties appear to support changes in measured organic matter concentrations indicating different optical properties of the water inside the lagoon during spring and autumn seasons. The ocean color remote sensing, with properly validated and tested robust algorithms, accommodating optically shallow waters, can provide valuable tools for monitoring and timely detection of possibly detrimental changes inside the lagoon.

However, for small eukaryotic organisms, as species from zooplankton, classical methods face numerous challenges. Here, we propose the concept of allelic differential expression at the population-scale (psADE) to investigate the variation in allele expression in natural populations. We developed a novel approach to detect psADE based on metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from environmental samples. This approach was applied on the widespread marine copepod,Oithona similis,by combining samples collected during theTaraOceans expedition (2009-2013) and de novo transcriptome assemblies. Among a total of 25,768 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) ofO. similis, 572 (2.2%) were affected by psADE in at least one population (FDR < 0.05). The distribution of SNVs under psADE in different populations is significantly shaped by population genomic differentiation (Pearsonr = 0.87,p = 5.6 x 10(-30)), supporting a partial genetic control of psADE. Moreover, a significant amount of SNVs (0.6%) were under both selection and psADE (p < .05), supporting the hypothesis that natural selection and psADE tends to impact common loci. Population-scale allelic differential expression offers new insights into the gene regulation control in populations and its link with natural selection.

A first algorithm using submodular flow optimization is easy to state, but intricate to implement. In a second approach we present a simple algorithm with O(knm(2)) time delay and amortized time O(m(2)), which improves over the analysis of the submodular flow algorithm. As ingredients, we obtain enumeration algorithms for the alpha-orientations of a graph G in O(m(2)) time delay and for the outdegree sequences attained byk-arc-connected orientations of G in O(knm(2)) time delay.

In this spirit, 36 characteristic events-22 bora and 14 sirocco storms occurring between 1979 and 2019, were selected and ran in evaluation mode in order to estimate the skill of the kilometer-scale Adriatic Sea and Coast (AdriSC) modelling suite used in this study and to provide baseline conditions for the climate change impact. The pseudo-global warming (PGW) methodology-which imposes an additional climatological change to the forcing used in the evaluation simulations, was implemented, for the very first time, for a coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere model and used to assess the behavior of the selected storms under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 greenhouse gas projections. The findings of this experiment are that, on the one hand, the AdriSC model is found capable of reproducing both the Adriatic waves associated with the 36 storms and the northern Adriatic surges occurring during the sirocco events and, on the other hand, the significant wave heights and peak periods are likely to decrease during all future extreme events but most particularly during bora storms. The northern Adriatic storm surges are in consequence also likely to decrease during sirocco events. As it was previously demonstrated that the Adriatic extreme wind-wave events are likely to be less intense in a future warmer climate, this study also proved the validity of applying the PGW methodology to coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere models at the coastal and nearshore scales.

The contribution of this article is twofold. First, we prove the global exponential convergence of this observer through the existence of bounds for the Riccati matrix. Second, we show that, under certain conditions on the sampling procedure, the observer's asynchronous continuous-discrete Riccati equation is stable and also, that its solution is bounded from above and below. An example, inspired by mobile robotics, with three outputs available is given for illustration purposes.

We assessed the river's discharge with hydrological observations and we explored floods characteristics influencing its solid discharge [1]. The location of the monitoring station near the river's mouth was selected accordingly to accessibility and technical constraints, as far downstream as possible. The vast majority of tributaries (such as possible underground springs, stormwater outlets, urban runoff) were taken into account. A multi-parameter probe (temperature, pressure, turbidity and electric conductivity) and a sediment trap were deployed continuously for 17 months, from October 2012 to March 2014. At the river's sources, probes (temperature, water height) were deployed to characterized karst springs. Times series were averaged at a daily time step, and water height converted in discharge when the rating curve was available. Sediment samples were analyzed for grain-size distribution. Datasets may help to estimate karsts' contributions to the Mediterranean Sea and to assess their influence on rivers discharge and solid yield. Stakeholders may also use the maximum water height to evaluate the flooding risk. Our data also contribute to linking the catchment freshwater to the coastal sea, a connection yet to be fully explored. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Rectifying antennas for energy harvesting from the microwaves to visible light: A review								PROGRESS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS				72						100265	10.1016/j.pquantelec.2020.100265			AUG 2020	2020	Rectifying antennas are often prensented as a potentiel technological breakthrough for energy harvesting. First theorized in the 1970's, the downsizing of an antenna coupled with a rectifier has become technologically achievable with the progresses of fabrication techniques such as electron beam or photolithography. However, reaching infrared or visible region of the electromagnetic spectra still entails challenges on the integration of a rectifier operating in the terahertz range. New bottom up approaches are likely to bring a promising solution to this issue. To improve our understanding of the key points of rectifying antennas' design for the infrared and visible light, and the challenges of device fabrication, this work reviews the progresses of this technology, going back from the first historical RF energy harvesting systems and covering the most innovative trends to this date.

Light Fidelity (LiFi) promises to be an interesting alternative by using the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum instead of the RF part as nearly all existing wireless transmission systems do. A basic LiFi system is composed of one intensity-controlled light-emitting diode (LED) and one receiver device sensitive to very high-frequency (thus invisible to human sight) modulations of the luminous intensity. In most cases, the photoreceptor is a silicon photodiode of PIN (P-type intrinsic N-type) or APD (Avalanche photodiode) conception. Recently, a few studies suggest that photovoltaic (PV) modules could be used to implement outdoor LiFi transmissions, i.e., under direct sunlight exposure. In this paper, we propose to compare the behavior of a PV module and a commercial APD-based photodetector (without any optical lens or colored filter) for experimental LiFi transmissions on both indoor and outdoor conditions. The performance of the two solutions is quantified in terms of various frequency responses like attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio, or bit-error rate. The results show that, while the photodiode exhibits very good performance in indoor conditions, its frequency response is rapidly deteriorating when a sunlight exposure of more than 200 W/m(2) is superimposed over the LiFi signal. We demonstrate that a PV module in V-oc (open-circuit voltage) condition still operates a LiFi transmission under additional solar illumination.

This study focuses on shoreline extraction and shoreline evolution using high spatial resolution satellite images in the presence of foam. A multispectral supervised classification technique is selected, namely the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and applied with three classes which are land, foam and water. The merging of water and foam classes followed by a segmentation procedure enables the separation of land and ocean pixels. The performance of the method is evaluated using a validation dataset acquired on two study areas (south and north of the bay of Sendai-Japan). On each site, WorldView-2 multispectral images (eight bands, 2 m resolution) were acquired before and after the Fukushima tsunami generated by the Tohoku earthquake in 2011. The consideration of the foam class enables the false negative error to be reduced by a factor of three. The SVM method is also compared with four other classification methods, namely Euclidian Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper, Maximum Likelihood, and Neuronal Network. The SVM method appears to be the most efficient to determine the erosion and the accretion resulting from the tsunami, which are societal issues for littoral management purposes.

Paints were formulated using these diblock copolymers as binders, without any biocides, or associated with low amounts of biocidal compounds such as dicopper oxide (Cu2O), 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazole-3-one (DCOIT), and 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile. All the coatings exhibited a hydrophobic surface at the initial stage with an evolving surface chemistry when immersed in artificial seawater. The erosion of the coatings was shown to be driven by the molar proportion of MATM2 units in the diblock copolymer. The antifouling properties were evaluated by in situ static immersion in the Mediterranean Sea. Cu2O (20 wt %)-DCOIT (2 wt %)-based coatings with 30 mol % of MATM2 in the seawater-hydrolyzable binder exhibited similar antifouling performances to a commercially available self-polishing coating over 16 months of field immersion. Contact angles and mass loss measurements, as well as scanning electron microscopy observations enabled the investigation of the parameters influencing the antifouling activity of the coatings.

Adenosine is released mostly by endothelial cells and myocytes during ischemia or hypoxia and greatly regulates the cardiovascular system via four specific G-protein-coupled receptors named A(1)R, A(2A)R, A(2B)R, and A(3)R. Among them, A(2)subtypes are strongly expressed in coronary tissues, and their activation increases coronary blood flow via the production of cAMP in smooth muscle cells. A(2A)receptor modulators are an opportunity for intense research by the pharmaceutical industry to develop new cardiovascular therapies. Most innovative therapies are mediated by the modulation of adenosine release and/or the activation of the A(2A)receptor subtypes. This review aims to focus on the specific exploration of the adenosine plasma level and its relationship with the A(2A)receptor, which seems a promising biomarker for a diagnostic and/or a therapeutic tool for the screening and management of coronary artery disease. Finally, a recent class of selective adenosine receptor ligands has emerged, and A(2A)receptor agonists/antagonists are useful tools to improve the management of patients suffering from coronary artery disease.

Bonnet Carre Spillway freshwater transport and corresponding biochemical properties in the Mississippi Bight								CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH				199						104114	10.1016/j.csr.2020.104114			AUG 1 2020	2020	Large freshwater pulses to coastal ecosystems change local hydrologic regimes and alter biogeochemical processes. The Mississippi Bight coastal ecosystem, located in the northern Gulf of Mexico shelf, is influenced by extensive freshwater inputs: the Mississippi River (MSR) and several smaller rivers to the east. Under river flood conditions, MSR waters flow through the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) to relieve pressure on levees in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 2015, mild wintertime temperatures and heavy rainfall throughout the MSR watershed led to extreme flooding and prompted an unusually early BCS opening on January 10, 2016 for 23 days. This study examines the effects of such intermittent freshwater diversions on local shelf circulation, planktonic distributions, and potential contaminant transport pathways. Physical, chemical, and remote sensing data collected one month after the BCS opening suggested the region was comprised of three water masses: shelf saltwater, MSR waters, and local river waters. Observations and circulation model results showed the BCS waters remained within the estuarine lakes and sounds, where winter wind patterns mixed the waters and prevented BCS waters from flowing onto the shelf. Freshwater within the Mississippi Bight was primarily from concurrent flooding of local rivers. Two distinct clusters of microplankton (offshore versus nearshore stations) and zooplankton (Chandeleur Sound versus other stations) community compositions were detected. No algal blooms were observed during this BCS opening. The 2016 wintertime BCS opening resulted in muted effects on the sounds and shelf because of its short duration and uncharacteristically early release.

The fidelity of continuous scanning Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is demonstrated on a single Pt nanoparticle in a flow reactor at 400 degrees C in an Ar-based gas flowed at 50 ml/min. We show a reduction of 30% in total scan time compared to conventional step-by-step scanning. The reconstructed Bragg electron density, phase, displacement and strain fields are in excellent agreement with the results obtained from conventional step-by-step scanning. Continuous scanning will allow to minimise sample instability under the beam and will become increasingly important at diffraction-limited storage ring light sources.

In this context, we have developed a material with glucose bound to ferrocene to prevent surface absorption. Glucose brings the polarity while ferrocene has the role of varying the state of charge of the surface. We therefore describe the synthesis of 6-deoxy-6-(4-ferrocenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-1-(4-aminophenyl)-beta-D-glucopyranose 6 and its immobilization on the surface of a C electrode and develop a methodology used for antibacterial testing. We were able to demonstrate that the immobilization of glucose 6 could be done in an artificial seawater environment by oxidation of an amine. The use of a 96-microwell platform equipped with electrodes for cyclic voltammetry, linked to a potentiostat, allowed the electrical solicitation of the coating in the presence of marine bacteria with a greater number of biological replicates. We have shown that the coating has an antibacterial effect, and this effect is accentuated when the coating is electrically stressed, resulting in the appearance and disappearance of charge on ferrocene, a phenomenon that seems to be conducive to colonization by bacteria.

The high level of organic matter in sludges can be valorized by co-composting with green waste. Many chemical changes occur in the compost maturation process, resulting on stabilized organic matter by humification which is recoverable as soil amendment. In this way, the knowledge of organic matter stability and maturity of compost is essential. However, estimation of chemical parameters allowing the management of compost quality usually need complex time consuming laboratory measurements. Indeed, there is not yet rapid, simple and robust method for their on site assessment at the moment. Among usual parameters used to monitor compost evolution, the C/N ratio is a fundamental chemical parameter. The aim of this work is the estimation of the C/N ratio using a Partial Least Squares regression based on UV and fluorescence spectroscopic data and pH from compost water extracts at various steps of composting process and measured on site. A mathematical linear model is established based on selected data (pH, spectroscopic indices) resulting on average relative error for C/N estimation of 5.26% (range between 0.5% min. and 9.5% max.). This tool leads to a rapid and simple on site estimation of the compost stabilization, allowing qualification of the end-product resulting on a global spectroscopic index of stability.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				726						138456	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138456			JUL 15 2020	2020	Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; similar to 30-150 m depth) are among the most biologically diverse and least protected ecosystems in the world's oceans. However, discussions regarding the conservation of these unique ecosystems are scarce. To address this issue, we identified the features of MCEs that demonstrate they should be considered as a global conservation priority. Some MCEs are characterized by theirwell-preserved and unique seascapes; their narrow environmental tolerance and high vulnerability to anthropogenic effects; and their slow recovery and reduced reproductive performance. The unique biodiversity of MCEs includes depth-adapted specialist species and new species, most of which are threatened or important fishery resources. MCEs also provide refuge against human stressors, valuable ecosystem services, and ecological connectivity. MCEs generally meet the criteria to be classified as Ecologically and Biologically Significant Marine Areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity. However, we highlight that many MCEs worldwide are threatened and not yet adequately protected by fishery regulations, marine protected areas, or considered in marine spatial planning. Establishing MCEs as a global conservation priority requires the designation of national, international, transnational, public, and private policies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DTA/TGA, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV-vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) techniques were used for material characterization. The (XRD) patterns of as-synthesized Sr-doped Ca-3(PO4)(2) solid solution samples exhibited a systematic shift toward lower angles by possessing a single rhombohedral crystal structure without any secondary phases. The UV light driven photocatalytic activity was assessed for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation. As a result, ultrafast photodegradation activity was observed after Sr doping. Moreover, the 30 wt% Sr-Ca-3(PO4)(2) sample showed the highest photocatalytic degradation among the Sr-doped Ca-3(PO4)(2) samples toward RhB. It was further suggested that as-synthesized 30 wt% Sr-Ca-3(PO4)(2) superior photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the more proficient partition of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, the involved mechanism of superior photocatalytic performance of the 30 wt% Sr-Ca-3(PO4)(2) solid solution was also investigated. In addition, regeneration cycles indicated the higher stability of the photocatalyst to be effectively recycled up to four times without any considerable reduction in photocatalytic performance. Thus, these informations further provides us a scalable pathway to fabricate Sr doped Ca-3(PO4)(2) and its consequent use as an efficient photocatalyst for rhodamine B (RhB) contaminated wastewater treatment.

MWC users suffer from musculoskeletal disorders and need assistance while moving. The purpose of this work is to predict the direction and speed of movement in MWCs from EMG data prior to movement initiation. This prediction could be used by MWC to assist users in their displacement by doing a smart electrical assistance based on displacement prediction. Design:Experimental study. Setting:Trained Subject LAMIH Laboratory. Participants:Eight healthy subjects trained to move in manual wheelchairs. Interventions:Subjects initiated the movement in three directions (front, right and left) and with two speeds (maximum speed and spontaneous speed) from two hand positions (on the thighs or on the handrim). A total of 96 movements was studied. Activation of 14 muscles was recorded bilaterally at the deltoid anterior, deltoid posterior, biceps brachii, pectoralis major, rectus abdominis, obliquus externus and erector spinae. Outcome Measures:Prior amplitude, prior time and anticipatory postural adjustments were measured. A hierarchical multi-class classification using logistic regression was used to create a cascade of prediction models. We performed a stepwise (forward-backward) selection of variables using the Bayesian information criterion. Percentages of well-classified movements have been measured through the means of a cross-validation. Results:Prediction is possible using the EMG parameters and allows to discriminate the direction / speed combination with 95% correct classification on the 6 possible classes (3 directions * 2 speeds). Conclusion:Action planning in the static position showed significant adaptability to the forthcoming parameters displacement. The percentages of prediction presented in this work make it possible to envision an intuitive assistance to the initiation of the MWC displacement adapted to the user's intentions.

We establish a relation between the limiting return times distribution and the probability of the cluster sizes, where clusters consist of the portion of points that have finite return times in the limit where random return times go to infinity. In the special case of periodic points we recover the known Polya-Aeppli distribution which is associated with geometrically distributed cluster sizes. We apply this method to several examples the most important of which is synchronisation of coupled map lattices. For the invariant absolutely continuous measure we establish that the returns to the diagonal is compound Poisson distributed where the coefficients are given by certain integrals along the diagonal.

This study addresses the role played by diffusion in the nutrient enrichment of the LIW, a process particularly relevant inside step-layer structures extending down to deep waters - structures known as thermohaline staircases. Profiling float observations confirmed that staircases develop over epicentral regions confined in large-scale circulation features and maintained by saltier LIW inflows on the periphery. Thanks to a high profiling frequency over the 4-year period 2013-2017, float observations reveal the temporal continuity of the layering patterns encountered during the cruise PEACETIME and document the evolution of layer properties by about + 0.06 degrees C in temperature and +0.02 in salinity. In the Algerian Basin, the analysis of in situ lateral density ratios untangled double-diffusive convection as a driver of thermohaline changes inside epicentral regions and isopycnal diffusion as a driver of heat and salt exchanges with the surrounding sources. In the Tyrrhenian Sea, the nitrate flux across thermohaline staircases, as opposed to the downward salt flux, contributes up to 25 % of the total nitrate pool supplied to the LIW by vertical transfer. Overall, however, the nutrient enrichment of the LIW is driven mostly by other sources, coastal or atmospheric, as well as by inputs advected from the Algerian Basin.

A similar relationship does not exist for convective turbulence. In this paper, we propose an analytical expression relating epsilon and C-T(2) in the convective boundary layer (CBL), by taking into account the effects of nonlocal heat transport under convective conditions using the Deardorff countergradient model. Measurements using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-frequency response sensors to measure velocity and temperature fluctuations obtained during the two field campaigns conducted at Shigaraki MU observatory in June 2016 and 2017 are used to test this relationship between epsilon and C-T(2) in the CBL. The selection of CBL cases for analysis was aided by auxiliary measurements from additional sensors (mainly radars), and these are described. Comparison with earlier results in the literature suggests that the proposed relationship works, if the counter gradient term gamma(D) in the Deardorff model, which is proportional to the ratio of the variances of potential temperature theta and vertical velocity w, is evaluated from in situ (airplane and UAV) observational data, but fails if evaluated from large-eddy simulation (LES) results. This appears to be caused by the tendency of the variance of theta in the upper part of the CBL and at the bottom of the entrainment zone to be underestimated by LES relative to in situ measurements from UAVs and aircraft. We discuss this anomaly and explore reasons for it.

Objective. - A mediating model as influenced by various demographic variables was applied to explore the relationships between athletes' personal values and their unsanctioned aggression directly and indirectly through the mediating role of resistive self-regulatory efficacy, moral disengagement, and aggressiveness. Method. - A sample of 301 French competitors of different age (young: n= 200 and adult: n = 101), gender (male: n= 172 and female: n= 129), type of sport (high: n= 131 and low contact: n= 170), level of competition (beginner: n= 115, intermediate: n = 110, and advanced: n= 76), and length of practice (brief: n= 109, intermediate: n = 49, and extensive: n= 143) completed a questionnaire assessing the aforementioned variables. Results. - Structural equation modelling demonstrates that self-transcendence and self-enhancement values have only indirect negative and positive effects, respectively, on unsanctioned aggression through the full mediating effect of the mediators. Also, age, gender, and type of sport were predictive only of some personal values and mediators. Conclusion. - These findings offer evidence that resistive self-regulatory efficacy, moral disengagement, and aggressiveness are mediators that fully govern the impact of athletes' personal values and certain demographic variables on their unsanctioned aggression. Several limitations, implications and suggestions for further research are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Methods: In the National Child Development Study, 37 items regarding diet, alcohol and physical activity frequencies were recorded at ages 33 and 42 years. Some 6,169 women were included and 237 women reported cancer diagnosis before age 55 years. Cancer odds ratios (OR) were estimated by logistic regression for the highest versus the lowest tertile of nutritional lifestyle pattern score. Social determinants from birth to adulthood were introduced as potential confounders in logistic models using a life-course approach. Results: Four nutritional lifestyle patterns were identified: `Healthy active', 'Drinker', 'Sweet tooth' and 'Western'. The 'Drinker' pattern was significantly associated with increased cancer risk: covariates-adjusted OR = 1.65 (95% CI: 1.17-2.33; p = .004); p(trent) = .017 for all cancers combined, and 1.65 (95% CI: 1.06-2.58; p = . 03 ); P-trend = .07 for breast cancer. These associations were attenuated after entering social determinants of birth, childhood and adulthood in the model: covariates and social variables-adjusted OR = 1.54 (95% CI: 1.08-2.18; p = .016); p(trent) = .054 for all cancers combined, and 1.50 (95% CI: 0.95-2.38; p = .08); p(trend) = .19 for breast cancer. The other patterns were not associated with cancer risk. Conclusion: This study demonstrates an association between the 'Drinker' pattern and midlife cancer in British women. Social determinants across the life course explained a part, though modest, of this association.

We prove that the set of weak solutions is stable, meaning that any sequence of weak solutions contains a (weakly) convergent subsequence whose limit is again a weak solution to the original system. Such type of results is usually considered as the most essential step to the proof of the existence of weak solutions. This is the first result of this type in the mathematical literature. Nevertheless, the construction of weak solutions to this system however remains still an (difficult) open problem.

J	Sous, Damien; Castelle, Bruno; Mouragues, Arthur; Bonneton, Philippe								Field Measurements of a High-Energy Headland Deflection Rip Current: Tidal Modulation, Very Low Frequency Pulsation and Vertical Structure								JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				8	7					534	10.3390/jmse8070534			JUL 2020	2020	Headland rips, sometimes referred to as boundary rips, are rip currents flowing against natural or artificial obstructions extending seaward from the beach, such as headland or groynes. They can be driven either by the deflection of the longshore current against the obstacle or by alongshore variation in breaking wave height due to wave shadowing in the lee of the obstacle. The driving mechanism therefore essentially depends on the angle of wave incidence with respect to the natural or artificial obstruction. We analyze 42 days of velocity profile measurements against a natural headland at the high-energy meso-macrotidal beach of Anglet, southwest France. Measurements were collected in 6.5-10.5-m depth as tide elevation varied, during the autumn-winter period with offshore significant wave height and period ranging 0.9-6 m and 8-16 s, respectively, and the angle of wave incidence ranging from -20 degrees to 20 degrees. Here we analyze deflection rip configurations, corresponding to approximately 24 days of measurements, for which the current meter was alternatively located in the rip neck, rip head or away from the rip as wave and tide conditions changed. Deflection rips were associated with large offshore-directed velocities (up to 0.6 m/s depth-averaged velocities) and tide modulation for low- to moderate-energy waves. The vertical profile of deflection rips was found to vary from depth-uniform in the rip neck to strongly depth-varying further offshore in the rip head with maximum velocities near the surface. Very low frequency motions of the rip were dramatic, ranging 10-60 min with a dominant peak period of approximately 40 min, i.e., with longer periods than commonly reported. The strong offshore-directed velocities measured well beyond the surf zone edge provide new insight into deflection rips as a dominant mechanism for water and sediment exchanges between embayed (or structurally-controlled) beaches and the inner-shelf and/or the adjacent embayments.

In situ grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements were carried out to probe the ordering of polymers and to measure the strain of the polymer chains under uniaxial tensile tests. A maximum 10% tensile stretching was applied (i.e., beyond the relaxation threshold). Interestingly we found different behaviors upon stretching the polymer: fullerene blends with the modified polymer; fullerene blends with the 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) additive. Overall, the strain in the system was almost twice as low in the presence of additive. The inclusion of additive was found to help in stabilizing the system and, in particular, the pi-pi packing of the donor polymer chains.

FD-SOI has improved, by far, the robustness to single event effect (SEE), while TID may require fine control in high krad regime, leading to the interest for an integrated dynamic monitoring capability. The digital dosimeter is therefore implemented with a simplified TID hardware model and monitoring structure, capable of tracking and reporting TID value while being quasi-insensitive to voltage and temperature variations. The dosimeter is experimentally validated with gamma rays, showing less than 5% mismatch in dose estimate in the 0 to 50-krad(Si) range. Low-energy photons and alpha particles were used to extend the measurements to other sources and up to 500 krad(Si), where the mismatch with the theoretical estimate remains limited to 16%. The digital dosimeter, with an area of 0.002 mm(2) and a very low imprint, is a suitable companion for any system requiring dynamic TID monitoring.

The study focuses on the radiation response of eight III-V materials: GaAs, AlAs, InP, InAs, GaSb, InSb, GaN, and GaP. For each semiconductor, the interaction rates of a bulk material target exposed to a neutron source mimicking the atmospheric neutron spectrum at sea level are evaluated both from a direct calculation using nuclear cross section libraries and by Geant4 simulations. The latter are also used to investigate in detail the reaction rates per type of reaction (elastic, inelastic, and nonelastic) and to classify all of the neutron-induced secondary products considering their atomic number and energy. Implications for single event effects are analyzed and discussed, notably in terms of electrical charge deposited in the material with respect to the critical charge for technologies ranging from 180 to 14 nm.

The interest of using an unmixing method to determine the seabed composition from hyperspectral aerial images of coastal areas is investigated. Unmixing provides both seabed abundances and endmember reflectances. A sub-surface mixing model is presented, based on a recently proposed oceanic radiative transfer model that accounts for seabed adjacency effects in the water column. Two original non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)-based unmixing algorithms, referred to as WADJUM (Water ADJacency UnMixing) and WUM (Water UnMixing, no adjacency effects) are developed, assuming as known the water column bio-optical properties. Simulations show that WADJUM algorithm achieves performance close to that of the NMF-based unmixing of the seabed without any water column, up to 10 m depth. WUM performance is lower and decreases with the depth. The robustness of the algorithms when using erroneous information about the water column bio-optical properties is evaluated. The results show that the abundance estimation is more reliable using WADJUM approach. WADJUM is applied to real data acquired along the French coast; the derived abundance maps of the benthic habitats are discussed and compared to the maps obtained using a fixed spectral library and a least-square (LS) estimation of the seabed mixing coefficients. The results show the relevance of the WADJUM algorithm for the local analysis of the benthic habitats.

Nutrient budgets in the Saigon-Dongnai River basin: Past to future inputs from the developing Ho Chi Minh megacity (Vietnam)								RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS				36	6			974	990		10.1002/rra.3552			JUL 2020	2020	Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC, Vietnam) is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. In this paper, we attempt to analyse the dynamics of nutrients, suspended sediments, and water discharges in its aquatic systems today and in the future. The work is based on nine sampling sites along the Saigon River and one on the Dongnai River to identify the reference water status upstream from the urban area and the increase in fluxes that occur within the city and its surroundings. For the first time, the calculated fluxes allow drawing up sediment and nutrient budgets at the basin scale and the quantification of total nutrient loading to the estuarine and coastal zones (2012-2016 period). Based on both national Vietnamese and supplementary monitoring programs, we estimated the water, total suspended sediment, and nutrients (Total N, Total P, and dissolved silica: DSi) fluxes at 137 m(3)year(-1), 3,292 x 10(3)tonSS year(-1), 5,323 tonN year(-1), 450 tonP year(-1), and 2,734 tonSi year(-1)for the Saigon River and 1,693 m(3)year(-1), 1,175 x 10(3)tonSS year(-1), 31,030 tonN year(-1), 1,653 tonP year(-1), and 31,138 tonSi year(-1)for the Dongnai River, respectively. Nutrient fluxes provide an indicator of coastal eutrophication potential (indicator of coastal eutrophication potential), using nutrient stoichiometry ratios. Despite an excess of nitrogen and phosphorus over silica, estuarine waters downstream of the megacity are not heavily impacted by HCMC. Finally, we analysed scenarios of future trends (2025-2050) for the nutrient inputs on the basis of expected population growth in HCMC and improvement of wastewater treatment capacity. We observed that without the construction of a large number of additional wastewater treatment plants, the eutrophication problem is likely to worsen. The results are discussed in the context of the wastewater management policy.		[Nguyen, Tuyet T.

However, current methods to measure actual respiration from oxygen consumption at relevant spatial scales are not sensitive enough in oligotrophic environments where respiration rates are very low. To overcome this drawback, more sensitive indirect enzymatic approaches are commonly used as R proxies. The in vivo electron transport system (ETSvivo) assay, which measures the reduction of (2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride salt, INT) to INT-formazan in the presence of natural substrate levels, was recently proposed as an indirect reliable estimation of R for natural plankton communities. However, under in vivo conditions, formazan salts could be toxic to the cells. Here, we test the toxicity of 0.2 mM of final INT concentration, widely used for ETSvivoassays, on natural bacterial assemblages collected in coastal and oceanic waters off Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, subtropical North Atlantic), in eight independent experiments. After 0.5 h of incubation, a significant but variable decline in cell viability (14-49%) was observed in all samples inoculated with INT. Moreover, INT also inhibited leucine uptake in less than 90 min of incubation. In the light of these results, we argue that enzymatic respiratory rates obtained with the ETSvivomethod need to be interpreted with caution to derive R in oceanic regions where bacteria largely contribute to community respiration. Moreover, the variable toxicity on bacterial assemblages observed in our experiments questions the use of a single R/ETSvivorelationship as a universal proxy for regional studies.

Brains pose an explanatory challenge because entropy, which inexorably increases over time, is commonly associated with disorder and simplicity. Recently we showed how evolution is an entropic process, building structures - organisms - which themselves facilitate entropy growth. Here we suggest that key transitional points in evolution extended organisms' reach into space and time, opening channels into new regions of a complex multidimensional state space that also allow entropy to increase. Brain evolution enabled representation of space and time, which vastly enhances this process. Some of these channels lead to tiny, dead-ends in the state space: the persistence of complex life is thus not thermodynamically guaranteed.

This paper proposes a new method to overcome those issues by addressing the following novel concepts. First, different Gaussian-based kernels are taken into account as an effective filtered pre-processing with low computational cost to point out robust and invariant features. Second, a discriminative operator, named Local Rubik-based Pattern (LRP), is introduced to adequately capture both shape and motion cues of DTs by proposing a new concept of complemented components together with an effective encoding method. In addition, it also addresses a novel thresholding to take into account rich spatio-temporal relationships extracted from a new model of neighborhood supporting region. Finally, an efficient framework for DT description is presented by exploiting operator LRP for encoding various instances of Gaussian-based volumes in order to form a robust descriptor against noise, changes of illumination, scale, and environment. Experiments for DT classification on benchmark datasets have authenticated the interest of our proposal. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Total and dissolved Cu and Pb concentrations, DGT-labile Pb, ultraphytoplankton abundance and structure were monitored at four sites: dredging site, dumping site (inside/outside of a geotextile bag) and reference site. During the reference period (non-dredging), an increasing contamination in Pb, Cu and a progressive shift from Synechococcus to photosynthetic picoeukaryotes dominance was observed from reference to dumping site. Pb concentrations were significantly higher during dredging period, pointing out sediment resuspension as Pb major source of contamination. Unlike Pb, Cu concentrations were not statistically different during the two periods. Dredging period did not impact on ultraphytoplankton abundance and structure but influence heterotrophic prokaryotes abundance. Sediment resuspension is therefore a major driver of chemical and biological qualities in Toulon Bay. Furthermore, although the geotextile bag reduces particulate transport of the dredged sediment, the transport in the dissolved phase remains a major problem.

Revisiting the pressure effect on carbon migration in iron								MATERIALS LETTERS				270						127725	10.1016/j.matlet.2020.127725			JUL 1 2020	2020	Carbon migration in bcc-iron drives the kinetics of numerous phenomena occurring during ageing of steels, such as segregation at structural defects and iron-carbide precipitation. Internal stresses are often encountered in steel microstructures and are known to affect the diffusivity of carbon. The effect of pressure on carbon diffusivity is related to the carbon migration volume. Unfortunately, theoretical and experimental studies on this migration volume are scarce and sometimes contradictory with one another. In this paper, we provide new ab initio results on carbon migration and compute the effect of an applied pressure on diffusivity. Our results are consistent with known crystallographic and relaxation data. They show that carbon diffusivity in bcc-iron can be enhanced by applying compressive pressure, a counter-intuitive and unusual effect in steels. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It also marked the climax of the politicization of European integration, as highlighted by the post-functionalist theory. The UK Independence party (UKIP) is pivotal in this process: it is both a product of this politicization and one of its major agents. As such, from a European viewpoint, UKIP stands as a case in point, an illustration of the potentially disruptive impact of such parties on national and European arenas. Building on Putnam's two level-game, on Tsebelis' nested games and on Reif and Schmitt's first and second order, this article aims to show that UKIP stands as the very embodiment of the interaction between these two arenas - between first- and second-order games. It perfectly illustrates the fact that the referendum reconfigured the national game that created it. This paper will therefore explore those two aspects: how UKIP impacted the first-order game, and conversely how the referendum impacted UKIP. Finally, the paper will analyze the disruptive impact of UKIP's successor, the Brexit party, on the British and European arenas.

These studies are mostly performed in post processing and based on linear modal analysis. However, many studied devices highlight that modal parameters depend on the vibration level non linearities and are performed with sensors as accelerometers that modify the dynamics of the device. This work proposes a significant evolution of modal testing based on the real time identification of non linear parameters (natural frequencies and damping) tracked with a linear modal basis. This method, called Kinematic-SAMI (for multiSensors Assimilation Modal Identification) is assessed firstly on a numerical case with known non linearities and secondly in the framework of a classical cantilever beam with contactless measurement technique (high speed and high resolution cameras). Finally, the efficiency and the limits of the method are discussed.

Humic-like acids (HLA) that simulate geochemical processes can be prepared by NaOH aqueous extraction from hydrochars produced by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). HLA can exhibit properties such as those found in HA from soils, which are known for their ability to interact with inorganic and organic compounds. The molecular characteristics of HLA and HA help to explain the relationship between their molecular features and their interaction with metallic species. The aim of this study is to assess the molecular features of HA extracted from Terra Mulata (TM) and HLA from hydrochars as well as their interaction with metals by using Cu(II) ions as a model. The results from C-13 NMR, elemental analysis, FTIR, and UV-Vis showed that HA are composed mostly of aromatic structures and oxygenated functional groups, whereas HLA showed a mutual contribution of aromatic and aliphatic structures as main constituents. The interactions of HA and HLA with Cu(II) ions were evaluated through fluorescence quenching, in which the density of complexing sites per gram of carbon for interaction was higher for HLA than for HA. Furthermore, the HLA showed similar values for stability constants, and higher than those found for other types of HA in the literature. In addition, the average lifetime in both humic extracts appeared to be independent of the copper addition, indicating that the main mechanism of interaction was static quenching with a non-fluorescent ground-state complex formation. Therefore, the HLA showed the ability to interact with Cu(II) ions, which suggests that their application can provide a new approach for remediation of contaminated areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Professional and recreational fishers from the Mediterranean coasts and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and Macaronesia have reported individuals of white seabream that became "like a tire" after cooking, and consequently inedible. The phenomenon was related neither to the freshness of the fish nor to the way it had been preserved or cooked. According to recreational fishers, this Abnormally Tough Specimen (ATS) phenomenon appeared singularly in time, in different places and to different extents. This singular, scattered appearance, with no area of origin from which to spread, de facto excluded any process of contagion. In order to compensate for the lack of knowledge and understanding related to this issue, we undertook a first study that aimed at addressing the extent of the white seabream anomaly in the western Mediterranean. To reach this objective, we carried out surveys on voluntary basis among fishers (both professional and recreational) and researchers throughout the western Mediterranean. Data from the surveys (n = 270) were then analyzed to evaluate the distribution of ATS and its possible relationship with human activities. Results showed that the anomaly affected the white seabream and very occasionally some other species, mainly of the same family Sparidae. In addition, the phenomenon did not occur simultaneously in the different areas surveyed over the last years and in some places it seems to have disappeared. We highlighted a possible link between ATS occurrence and the presence of human activities in adjacent areas. We hypothesized pollution - including by copper - could be a possible driver of ATS. Results suggested a tendency of ATS to cluster around fish farms and commercial and industrial ports, although we are aware other human factors might also influence the phenomenon. To conclude, the present study gives an overview of the importance of the white seabream anomaly in the Mediterranean and encourages further research to disentangle the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

Classical signal processing techniques as filtering were developed for the speech enhancement to overcome unintentional effects as the propagation channel. However, the delay effect remains an open challenge for audio signal processing engineers. A voice/song signal (VSS) prediction is investigated theoretically and experimentally in this paper. This VSS engineering allows to predict an arbitrary waveformsignal by using a lowpass negative group delay (NGD) function. This outstanding function presents the VSS advance properties when its parameters are matched with the operated signals. This NGD engineering analytical approach is described with the audio signal processing. The low-pass NGD analysis and property are deeply investigated with two NGD RC- and RLpassive cells. NGD transient study is performed with parametric analytical signals presenting raised cosine waveform. The introduced VSS NGD sensoring is verified with experimental real-time tests of microphone VSS generator. VSS time-advance of approximately 50 mu s was observed with a good agreement between simulations and measurements.

Harmonic oscillator tank: A new method for leakage and energy reduction in a water distribution network with pressure driven demand								ENERGY				201						117657	10.1016/j.energy.2020.117657			JUN 15 2020	2020	It is now well established that rate of leakage of water is directly related to the distribution pressure in a network. In this context, pumps can consume up to 60% of the overall energy requirement in the case of pressure driven demand whereby they are solicited for direct supply. In this paper, we investigate the energy efficiency of distribution in an experimental network which is embedded with two levels of leakage (low and high) using three different methods. They are analysed and compared in terms of specific energy consumption and rate of leakage. A novel concept known as the Harmonic Oscillator Tank has been developed whereby the conventional hydropneumatic tank is pressure modulated so as to produce a constant output flowrate within the presence of leaks. Experimental results show that the throughput of the Harmonic Oscillator Tank for a heavy leaking network is highest (86.45%) with the lowest percentage leakage of 13.5% at a specific energy consumption of only 0.354 kWh/m(3)/day when compared to the other two schemes namely direct pumping and pumping through a variable speed drive in a loop. This Harmonic Oscillator Tank opens up new avenues for reducing energy and leakage in old damaged networks whereby a short or medium-term solution is often required since infrastructure renewal requires time and a massive investment.

In this study Diffusive Gradients in Thin films (DGT) technique with two different pore size was used to evaluate the potentially bioavailable fractions (DGT-labile) of Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn at various depths of a highly stratified estuary (the Krka River estuary, Croatia) both in winter and summer. DGT-labile concentrations were compared to (1) total dissolved concentrations, (2) concentrations of labile species measured by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV-labile) for Cu and (3) concentrations derived by chemical speciation modelling. High correlation between dissolved and DGT-labile concentrations was found for all metals, except for Zn where contamination problems prevented reliable conclusions. Percentages of DGT-labile fractions over total dissolved concentrations were (AVG +/- SD): 92 +/- 3%, 64 +/- 2%, 23 +/- 5%, 61 +/- 3% and 57 +/- 6% for Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni and Co, respectively. No significant difference was found between trace metal concentrations measured with an open pore and restricted pore devices, implying the predominance of kinetically labile metal complexes smaller than 1 nm. For Cu, ASV-labile and DGT labile concentrations were highly correlated (0.97) with ASV-labile concentration being around 35% lower than that of the DGT-labile. Modelling of chemical speciation reliably predicted dynamic (free, inorganic and part of organic complexes) concentration of Cd, whereas dynamic concentrations of Cu and Pb were underestimated by 32% and 65%, respectively. In view of the relative simplicity of DGT devices, they are well suited for the monitoring effort of coastal waters, informing on potentially bioavailable concentrations of TM and thereby, helping to achieve good environmental status of coastal waters, as stipulated within the EU Water Framework Directive.

Considering circular economy approach and for increasing OM availability, water soaked date palm waste was co-composted with goat manure in aerated windrow to produce a soil organic amendment. The OM biodegradation was mainly controlled based on biological parameters and spectroscopic techniques. The results showed a rapid temperature increase during the first week, and a relatively long compost maturity phase. The OM content reduction was of 36% and C/N ratio shifted from 60 to 20 at the process end. During the composting process, the specific ultraviolet absorbance SUVA254, SUVA269 and the SUVA 280 values increase confirmed the OM and hydrophilic compounds degradation, as well as substrate content oxidation into aromatic compounds. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses of the different samples collected during the process exhibited both OM biodegradation and mineralization. The 3 absorption ratios 1650/2845, 1525/2925 and 2920/1640 confirmed an aromaticity increase by aromatic structures biosynthesis, such as humic-like and fulvic-like substances, with the decomposition/transformation of aliphatic components, polysaccharides, and alcohols. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (FEEM) spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) evidenced the dissolved organic matter (DOM) humification. A four-component model was obtained, i.e. humic-like component (S1, S2 and S3) and fulvic-like component (S4). The produced compost didn't exhibit any phytotoxicity evidenced by cress seed germination index exceeding 80%. All the analyses confirmed the good quality of the compost issued from mixed date palm waste and goat manure.

Adaptation of Anses' benchmarks								ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH				78	1					52	10.1186/s13690-020-00432-z			JUN 3 2020	2020	Faced with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, regulatory measures aiming to prevent interpersonal contaminations have been undertaken and among these, lockdown. Due to strong restrictions out-of-home movements, we hypothesize that overall physical activity will decrease and sedentary behavior increase. This could result in highest exposure to the well-known risk related to insufficient physical activity. To mitigate physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors health-related risks related to children and adolescents lockdown and school closure, Anses (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety) has adapted, within the first days of the public authorities' prescription, its former benchmarks. This paper supports and comments Anses' Opinion by raising the questions of whether, why, and how to deal with short- or medium-term lockdown-related physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increases. Short-term and unknown long term-impacts on mental health and well-being, physical fitness and eating behaviors clearly appearing for children and adolescents as being the main issues of concern are highlighted. Targeting the compensations of the physical inactivity increase, the types, frequencies and durations of physical activity, are adapted to restricted environment. Sedentary behavior limitation and frequent interruptions becomes a priority. Overall, considering children and adolescents, the emerging risk justifies proposing specific adaptations and type of activities in order to ensure maintaining health underpinned, at least partly, by physiological equilibrium and physical fitness and avoid the installation of new unhealthy habits or routines that young people could keep after lockdown.

In this article, we investigated the specific influence of copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) on prokaryotic communities from the uncontaminated site, using mesocosm experiments. In addition, we studied how pre-exposure (i.e. life history) affects communities, with reference to previous metal exposure on the response of three prokaryotic communities to similar Cu exposition. This study showed a stronger influence of Cu contamination than Pb contamination on prokaryotic diversity and structure. We identified 12 and 34 bacterial families and genera, respectively, contributing to the significant differences observed in community structure between control and spiked conditions. Taken altogether, our results point toward a combination of direct negative responses to Cu contamination and indirect responses mediated by interaction with phytoplankton. These identified responses were largely conditioned by the previous exposure of community to contaminants.

The aim of this paper was to review and discuss the most recent studies addressing the possible relation between sustained elevated serum uric acid levels and the onset or worsening of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Original studies involving American teenagers clearly showed that serum uric acid levels were directly correlated with systolic and diastolic pressures, which has been confirmed in adult cohorts revealing a 2.21-fold increased risk of hypertension. Several studies involving patients with coronary artery disease support a role for serum uric acid level as a marker and/or predictor for future cardiovascular mortality and long-term adverse events in patients with coronary artery disease. Retrospective analyses have shown an inverse relationship between serum uric acid levels and renal function, and even a mild hyperuricemia has been shown to be associated with chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Interventional studies, although of small size, showed that uric acid (UA)-lowering therapies induced a reduction of blood pressure in teenagers and a protective effect on renal function. Taken together, these studies support a role for high serum uric acid levels (>6 mg/dL or 60 mg/L) in hypertension-associated morbidities and should bring awareness to physicians with regards to patients with chronic hyperuricemia.

JOURNAL OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY				28	3			489	498		10.1123/japa.2019-0190			JUN 2020	2020	Master athletes are often considered exemplars of successful aging, thanks to their capacity to maintain a high sports performance during their entire life. A high training capacity, regular participation in sporting competitions, and delayed alterations in body composition and physiological capacities have been listed among the main factors contributing to impressive master athletes' performances. However, there is a paucity of data on the metabolism and dietary habits of master athletes, and the question of whether they need to adapt their nutrition to the aging process remains open. Herein, the authors presented a contemporary overview of the metabolic challenges associated with aging, including the risk of low energy availability, anabolic resistance, and periods of metabolic crisis due to forced immobilization. After assembling scientific evidence to show that master athletes must adapt their dietary intake, the authors proposed a summary of nutritional recommendations for master athletes and suggested the next stage of research.

Analysing DTs to make them 'understandable' plays an important role in different applications of computer vision. In this study, an efficient approach for DT description is proposed by addressing the following novel concepts. First, the beneficial properties of dense trajectories are exploited for the first time to efficiently describe DTs instead of the whole video. Second, two substantial extensions of local vector pattern operator are introduced to form a completed model which is based on complemented components to enhance its performance in encoding directional features of motion points in a trajectory. Finally, the authors present a new framework, called directional dense trajectory patterns, which takes advantage of directional beams of dense trajectories along with spatio-temporal features of their motion points in order to construct dense-trajectory-based descriptors with more robustness. Evaluations of DT recognition on different benchmark datasets (i.e. UCLA, DynTex, and DynTex++) have verified the interest of the authors' proposal.

The problem is to describe the probability distribution of the orbit of the sum A+BWe study in particular the familiar case of coadjoint orbits, and also the orbits of self-adjoint real, complex and quaternionic matrices under the conjugation actions of SO(n) respectively. The probability density can be expressed in terms of a function that we call the volume function. In this paper, (i) we relate this function to the symplectic or Riemannian geometry of the orbits, depending on the case; (ii) we discuss its non-analyticities and possible vanishing; (iii) in the coadjoint case, we study its relation to tensor product multiplicities (generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients) and show that it computes the volume of a family of convex polytopes introduced by Berenstein and Zelevinsky. These considerations are illustrated by a detailed study of the volume function for the coadjoint orbits of B2=so(5).

Such a system is defined by a tuple (p,n,gamma,rho,E) where p, n, gamma are integers and E is an element of Z[X]In El Mrabet and Gama (in: WAIFI, lecture notes in computer science, Springer, 2012) conditions required to build AMNS with E(X)=Xn+1 are provided. In this paper, we generalise their approach and provide a method to generate multiple AMNS for a given prime p with E(X)=Xn-lambda and lambda is an element of Z\{0} Moreover, we propose a complete set of algorithms without conditional branching to perform arithmetic and conversion operations in the AMNS, using a Montgomery-like method described in Negre and Plantard (in: Information security and privacy, 13th Australasian conference, ACISP 2008, Wollongong, Australia, 2008). We show that our implementation outperforms GNU MP and OpenSSL libraries. Finally, we highlight some properties of the AMNS which state that it could lead to a helpful countermeasure against some side-channel attacks.

The goal is to respond to changing market needs while minimising adverse effects on the environment. Reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) - due to its flexibility and characteristics - can increase the system sustainability and responsiveness to satisfy the market needs. This paper considers an environmental oriented multi-objective process plan generation problem for a sustainable reconfigurable manufacturing system (SRMS). Three criteria are minimised respectively the sustainability-metric value, the total production time and the total production cost. As a new criterion, the sustainability-metric value considers both liquid hazardous waste and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). First, a multi-objective integer linear programming (MOILP) model is proposed. Second, due to the problem complexity, three approaches are adapted respectively a posteriori approach called augmented epsilon-constraint (AUGECON) and two evolutionary approaches namely, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEA-II). Finally, due to the lack of real world data and to illustrate the applicability of the three approaches, a simple numerical example is presented and the obtained numerical results are analysed.

It is then shown that both these models admit a common limit in the spacetime continuum, namely, a Lindblad equation with Dirac-fermion Hamiltonian part and, as Lindblad jumps, a chirality flip and a chirality-dependent phase flip, which are two of the three standard error channels for a two-level quantum system. This, as one may call it, Dirac Lindblad equation, provides a model of quantum relativistic spatial diffusion, which is evidenced both analytically and numerically. This model of spatial diffusion has the intriguing specificity of making sense only with original unitary models which are relativistic in the sense that they have chirality, on which the noise is introduced: the diffusion arises via the by-construction (quantum) coupling of chirality to the position. For a particle with vanishing mass, the model of quantum relativistic diffusion introduced in the present work, reduces to the well-known telegraph equation, which yields propagation at short times, diffusion at long times, and exhibits no quantumness. Finally, the results are extended to temporal noises which depend smoothly on position.

We find that the export of oxygenated waters by upwelling front turbulence is a major sink for nearshore dissolved oxygen. In our simulations of summer upwelling, when the phytoplankton population is generally dominated by diatoms whose growth is boosted by nutrient input, net primary production and air-sea exchange compensate dissolved-oxygen depletion by offshore export over the shelf. A shorter upwelling duration causes a relaxation of upwelling winds and a decrease in offshore export, resulting in a slight increase of net dissolved-oxygen enrichment in the coastal region as compared to longer upwelling durations. When phytoplankton is dominated by groups less sensitive to nutrient inputs, growth rates decrease, and the coastal region becomes net heterotrophic. Together with the physical sink, this lowers the net oxygenation rate of coastal waters, which remains positive only because of air-sea exchange. These findings help in disentangling the physical and biogeochemical controls of dissolved oxygen in upwelling systems and, together with projections of increased duration of upwelling seasons and phytoplankton community changes, suggest that the Iberian coastal upwelling region may become more vulnerable to hypoxia and deoxygenation.

The minimal wavelength excitation is found to be in the visible violet region, very close to 405 nm for all of the light-induced EPR lines. This points to a close relationship between their originating centers, despite the difference in their dynamics previously revealed by saturation recovery measurements. The study of the light-induced signals decay with time (after illumination removal) and with temperature (under constant illumination) confirms the existence of two groups of lines characterized by different dynamics. The quite unusual persistence of these magnetic states after excitation removal opens promising possibilities for encoding information within semiconducting nanoparticles.

In2S3 films were deposited on glass substrates by the spray pyrolysis technique. Different samples were prepared via changing the spray time in the range of 10-90 min. The film thickness varies from 0.8 mu m to 6.1 mu m. The X-ray diffraction results demonstrate that the In2S3 films are polycrystalline in nature and exhibit a cubic structure. Additionally, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and 3D profilometry examinations show that the surface roughness increases with the rising spray time. On the other hand, the oxygen adsorption versus working temperature was investigated. Sensing measurements with ethanol, methanol and acetone gases were carried out by a dynamic control of the current passing through the sensitive layers. The best sensitivity was obtained for the film matching a 70 min deposit time. An understanding of the detection mechanism based on the oxidation reaction between reduced vapors and chemisorbed oxygen was confirmed. The selectivity of the sensor was analyzed for several volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

PDMS-b-TRSiMA block copolymer additives without PEGMA units were also used as additives. The amphiphilic character of the coating surface was assessed in water using the captive air bubble technique for measurements of static and dynamic contact angles. The attachment of macro- and microorganisms on the coatings was evaluated by field tests and by performing adhesion tests to the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite and the green alga Ulva rigida. All the additive-based PDMS coatings showed better antiadhesion properties to A. amphitrite larvae than to U. rigida spores. Field tests provided meaningful information on the antifouling and fouling release activity of coatings over an immersion period of 23 months.

Each station is equipped with two piezometric sensors, the first immersed and the second emerged, which allows the calculation of the water level. Both piezometric sensors are also equipped with a temperature sensor. Water level and temperature data are analyzed and discussed, also considering meteorological data provided by Meteo-France stations. The tide gauges provide information about tide harmonic components, extreme water level, and seiching. Moreover, significant differences are observed between sheltered zones in enclosed bays and offshore zones, such as between the back of the Bay of Toulon and at the Port-Cros Island. Differences in water level up to 0.10 m are indeed observed under windy conditions, of the same order as the tidal range (order of 0.20 m) or the annual level variability due to the volumetric expansion (order of 0.10 m). Water level variations, up to about 1 m, are found to be mainly due to atmospheric effects, with a more or less isostatic behavior according to the weather events. In addition, seiching with an amplitude of few centimeters is observed within the Little Bay of Toulon, for east wind conditions. The near-surface water temperature is measured at the submerged piezometer location (depth of immersion range 0.10-1.80 m according to the station and to the water level). The analysis of the temperature associated with the weather conditions allows to detail a strong variability of the upwelling intensity under Mistral wind conditions in summer, leading to more or less pronounced temperature drops according to the shore configuration. The Bay of Toulon is more prone to the generation of upwellings than the neighboring bays. During winter, water exchanges between the Little Bay of Toulon and offshore are also clearly observed during windy conditions. The HTM-NET long-term observation network thus provides useful insights to increase our knowledge of the hydrodynamics and mass fluxes, and therefore enhances our modeling capacity and risk assessment at the scale of a bay.

Methods Fourteen children with JIA and 14 healthy controls matched for age and sex were included. Muscle characteristics, both structural (thickness, cross-sectional area (CSA) and fascicle angle) and qualitative (intermuscular adipose tissue; IMAT), were assessed in thigh muscles using ultrasound and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Muscle function and functional abilities were determined from the assessment of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) knee extensors force and vertical jump performance. Results No significant difference in MVIC force was observed between the two groups. However, squat jump height was significantly reduced in children with JIA (18.3 +/- 5.4 vs 24.3 +/- 7.9 cm, P < .05). No differences in structural parameters were observed, but IMAT/CSA (0.22 +/- 0.02 vs 0.25 +/- 0.03; P = .01) was significantly lower in children with JIA than in healthy children. Conclusion Knee extensor muscle architecture and force were comparable between children with and without JIA, but functional abilities (vertical jump performance) were poorer in JIA. The lower IMAT area in JIA could result from a lower physical activity level compared with healthy children.

J	Chami, Malik; Larnicol, Morgane; Migeon, Sebastien; Minghelli, Audrey; Mathieu, Sandrine								Potential for nocturnal satellite detection of suspended matter concentrations in coastal waters using a panchromatic band: a feasibility study based on VIIRS (NASA/NOAA) spectral and radiometric specifications								OPTICS EXPRESS				28	10			15314	15330		10.1364/OE.393048			MAY 11 2020	2020	Satellite remote sensing of coastal waters is important for understanding the functioning of these complex ecosystems. High satellite revisit frequency is required to permit a relevant monitoring of the strong dynamical processes involved in such areas, for example rivers discharge or tidal currents. One key parameter that is derived from satellite data is the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration. Knowledge of the variability of SPM could be used by sediment transport models for providing accurate predictions. Most of the current satellites that are dedicated to ocean color observations have a sun-synchronous orbit that performs a single daytime observation. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) ocean color sensor (NASA/NOAA) is the only one that is equipped with a panchromatic spectral band, so-called Day-Night Band, which is able to measure extremely low level signals, typically of the order of magnitude of 10(-5) W m(-2) sr(-1) mu m(-1). The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of the panchromatic and radiometric specifications of the VIIRS sensor to detect SPM concentrations from nighttime satellite observations. Realistic radiative transfer simulations are performed to quantitatively determine the amplitude of the top of atmosphere radiances under various conditions such as various moon incident illuminations, observation geometries, atmospheric and oceanic turbidities. The simulations are compared with the minimum detectable radiance as specified for the VIIRS sensor. The results show that the detection of SPM is systematically feasible, including in clear waters, for any observation geometries in the case of a full moon illumination. The sensitivity of the results to the lunar phase (i.e., out of the full moon conditions), which is one of the originalities of the study, shows that the detection should also be feasible for a significant number of nights over the entire lunar cycle, typically from 5 to 15 nights depending on the water turbidity. Therefore, nighttime ocean color panchromatic measurements performed using a VIIRS-like sensor are a highly promising approach, especially if it is combined with daytime observations, for improving the monitoring of ocean dynamics.

The main interest at visible and near-infrared frequencies is light management using high-refractive-index Mie-resonant dielectric particles. Most work in this area of research focuses on exploiting Si-based particles. Here, we study monocrystalline Mie-resonant particles made of Ge-rich SiGe alloys with refractive index higher than that of Si. These islands are formed via solid state dewetting of SiGe flat layers by using two different processes: (i) dewetting of monocrystalline SiGe layers (60%-80% Ge content) obtained via Ge condensation of SiGe on silicon on insulator; and (ii) dewetting of a SiGe layer deposited via molecular beam epitaxy on silicon on insulator and ex situ Ge condensation, forming a Ge-rich shell surrounding a SiGe-core. Using high-spatial-resolution Raman microscopy we monitor Ge content x and strain epsilon of flat layers and SiGe-islands. We observe strain relaxation associated with formation of trading dislocations in the SiGe islands compared to the starting SiGe layers, as confirmed by TEM images. For initial high Ge concentration in the flat layers, the corresponding Ge content in the dewetted islands is lower, owing to diffusion of Si atoms from Si or SiO2 into SiGe islands. The Ge content also varies from particle to particle on the same sample. Size and shape of the dewetted particles depend on the fabrication process: thicker initial SiGe layers lead to larger particles. Samples with narrow island size distribution display rather sharp Mie resonances in the 1000-2500 nm spectral range. Larger islands display Mie resonances at longer wavelength. Positions of the resonances are in agreement with the theoretical calculations in the discrete dipole approximation.

J	Saidi, Oussama; Davenne, Damien; Lehorgne, Cecile; Duche, Pascale								Effects of timing of moderate exercise in the evening on sleep and subsequent dietary intake in lean, young, healthy adults: randomized crossover study								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY				120	7			1551	1562		10.1007/s00421-020-04386-6			JUL 2020	2020	Purpose This work studied the acute effects in healthy adults of evening exercise timing on their quality of sleep and dietary intake over the following 12 h. Methods Sixteen men and women, (age: 22.3 +/- 1.4 years; BMI: 20.8 +/- 1.4 kg/m(2), intermediate chronotype) took part in three randomized crossover sessions spread over three consecutive weeks: control session (CTL), 1 h exercise session at 6:30 pm (E6:30) and 1 h exercise session at 8:30 pm (E8:30), in which exercise finished 4 h and 2 h before habitual bedtime, respectively. Exercise was an outdoor run at 60% HRmaxth. Energy expenditure and sleep were ambulatories monitored by accelerometry under free-living condition. Ad-libitum dinner and breakfast were used to measure subsequent energy intake and proportion of that energy derived from each macronutrient. Results Evening exercise did not disrupt sleep. Improvement in sleep quality compared to the control condition was observed only when exercise was performed 4 h before habitual bedtime (WASO: p < 0.01; SE: p < 0.02). Interestingly, our results give insight into differences in sleep parameters response to evening exercise between habitually poor and good sleepers mainly when it comes to sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset (all p < 0.01). There was no difference in calorie intake from ad-libitum dinner and breakfast. However, an association between improvement in sleep efficiency from acute exercise and reduction of energy intake the following morning was found. Conclusion Early evening exercise could offer a useful alternative for achieving better sleep in healthy young adults especially when it comes to poor sleepers.

Following a terminological insight into the linguistic and cognitive complexities of the notion, we proceed to a semantic analysis of press articles in major Anglo-Saxon newspapers, focusing on the explanation strategies used by the media to simplify their presentation. We show that in the mediation process, biopesticides (and co-referent terms) are systematically described as being environmentally friendly, and opposed to chemical pesticides, consistently shown to be detrimental to the environment. We hypothesize that this simplistic binary framing is exploited by journalists as it is easy to understand in a context of agroecological transition and commonly shared distrust for chemical pesticides. In that respect, it proves to be adequate for purposes of explanation and simplification. However, by outlining this discursive process based on duality, we aim to draw attention to the potential misconceptions of plant protection issues in general, and biopesticides in particular. We ultimately demonstrate that when adopting other perspectives (scientific, ontological or ethical), this dual framing proves to be inadequate for the construction of knowledge by any non-expert press reader.

In recent years, a powerful formalism that accomplishes both these goals has been developed, the so-called effective field theory of dark energy. It can capture the behavior of a wide class of modified gravity theories and classify them according to the imprints they leave on the smooth background expansion history of the Universe and on the evolution of linear perturbations. The effective field theory of dark energy is based on a Lagrangian description of cosmological perturbations which depends on a number of functions of time, some of which are non-minimal couplings representing genuine deviations from General Relativity. Such a formalism is thus particularly convenient to fit and interpret the wealth of new data that will be provided by future galaxy surveys. Despite its recent appearance, this formalism has already allowed a systematic investigation of what lies beyond the General Relativity landscape and provided a conspicuous amount of theoretical predictions and observational results. In this review, we report on these achievements. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Aims: The current trial named LAPIBSS aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of a 2-strain mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus to improve irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Methods: Eighty patients diagnosed for irritable bowel syndrome were recruited to a multicentre, double-blinded, in parallel groups, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Patients were provided with a daily dose of two capsules containing either probiotics (5 x 10(9) cfu/capsule) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was abdominal pain score assessed with a 100-mm visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes included scores of bloating, flatus and rumbling assessed with a 100-mm visual analogue scale, a composite score and bowel habits. Results: Abdominal pain score was significantly improved in both groups at weeks 4 and 8 (P < 0.0001), but no significant differences were found between groups at week 8 (19.0 +/- 2.5 vs 25.1 +/- 2.6, respectively; LS Means differences = 6.0 +/- 3.2; P = 0.06). Significant differences between groups were observed for flatus score at week 4 (P = 0.04) and week 8 (P = 0.03) and composite score (P = 0.04) at week 8. Conclusions: The consumption of the 2-strain mixture of L. acidophilus over 8 weeks is safe and decreases significantly flatus and composite scores.

These organisms play a key role in the ecosystem as prey of top predators and as predators of lower trophic level organisms, as well as in carbon export from the surface into deeper waters. This study used 38 kHz-EK60 acoustic echosounder data from six cruises spanning 2011-2017 to explore the seasonal and spatial variability in the vertical distribution of MTLOs' from 10 to 600 m in the New Caledonian (South Pacific) Exclusive Economic Zone. A total of 16715 acoustic vertical profiles of acoustic backscattering strength were clustered into homogeneous groups. Two small shallow scattering layers (SSLs) between 0 and 100 m, and one large deep scattering layer (DSL) at around 550 m depth, characterized the mean vertical distribution of MTLOs. A machine-learning model (eXtreme Gradient tree Boosting algorithm, XGBoost) was fitted to explain the acoustic profile clusters with environmental variables as predictors. Sun inclination was the most important factor in structuring the vertical profile shapes due to the diel vertical migration signal, followed by the mean oxygen value of the top 600 m. Bathymetry, euphotic depth, 0-600 m mean temperature and SST were the next most significant variables. Isotherm depth, surface chlorophylDa, wind, and mean salinity had a lower influence on the shape of the vertical profiles. The model was then used to construct vertical echograms at the scale of the New Caledonian EEZ, showing an accuracy up to 87% in cross validation. Across the EEZ, the shape of vertical acoustic profiles were comparable, though layer echo intensities varied spatially with a marked north-south gradient that remained relatively constant seasonally. The vertically-averaged acoustic values were characterized by a maximum to the south of the EEZ in summer, mainly driven by high oxygen values as well as shallow euphotic depth. We also estimated a migrant proportion between day DSL and night SSL of about 78%. Our methodology offers a promising approach for analyzing the control of the environment on the vertical distribution of MTLOs for other oceanic provinces, while also providing a framework to investigate the corresponding trophic interactions between MTLOs and their predators feeding at different depths and times. Moreover, our findings stress the need to consolidate knowledge on species composition to optimize acoustic data interpretation.

J	Chami, Malik; Larnicol, Morgane; Minghelli, Audrey; Migeon, Sebastien								Influence of the Suspended Particulate Matter on the Satellite Radiance in the Sunglint Observation Geometry in Coastal Waters								REMOTE SENSING				12	9					1445	10.3390/rs12091445			MAY 2020	2020	The analysis of satellite ocean color data that are acquired over coastal waters is highly relevant to gain understanding of the functioning of these complex ecosystems. In particular, the estimation of the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations is of great interest for monitoring the coastal dynamics. However, a high number of pixels of satellite images could be affected by the surface-reflected solar radiation, so-called the sunglint. These pixels are either removed from the data processing, which results in a loss of information about the ocean optical properties, or they are subject to the application of glint correction techniques that may contribute to increase the uncertainties in the SPM retrieval. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the high potential of exploiting satellite observations acquired in the sunglint viewing geometry for determining the water leaving radiance for SPM dominated coastal waters. For that purpose, the contribution of the water leaving radiance L-w to the satellite signal L-TOA is quantified for the sunglint observation geometry using forward radiative transfer modelling. Some input parameters of the model were defined using in-situ bio-optical measurements performed in various coastal waters to make the simulations consistent with real-world observations. The results showed that the sunglint radiance is not sufficiently strong to mask the influence of the oceanic radiance at the satellite level, which oceanic radiance remains significant (e.g., 40% at 560 nm for a SPM concentration value of 9 g m(-3)). The influence of the sunglint radiance is even weaker for highly turbid waters and/or for strong wind conditions. In addition, the maximum radiance simulated in the sunglint region for highly turbid waters remains lower than the saturation radiances specified for the current ocean color sensors. The retrieval of L-w and SPM should thus be feasible from radiances measured in the sunglint pattern by satellite sensors, thus increasing the number of exploitable pixels within a satellite image. The results obtained here could be used as a basis for the development of inverse ocean color algorithms that would interestingly use the radiance measured in sunglint observation geometry as it has been done for other topics than the field of ocean color research.

The coupling of AFM with infrared spectroscope (AFM-IR) provides another advantage to the chemical analyses and thus helps to shed light upon the study of polymers. This paper reviews some recent progress in the application of AFM and AFM-IR in polymer science. We describe the principle of AFM-IR and the recent improvements to enhance its resolution. We also discuss the latest progress in the use of AFM-IR as a super-resolution correlated scanned-probe infrared spectroscopy for the chemical characterization of polymer materials dealing with polymer composites, polymer blends, multilayers, and biopolymers. To highlight the advantages of AFM-IR, we report several results in studying the crystallization of both miscible and immiscible blends as well as polymer aging. Finally, we demonstrate how this novel technique can be used to determine phase separation, spherulitic structure, and crystallization mechanisms at nanoscales, which has never been achieved before. The review also discusses future trends in the use of AFM-IR in polymer materials, especially in polymer thin film investigation.

Meta-analysis revealed that protein carbonyls (SMD: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.77), total F2-isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 alpha (SMD: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.23 to 1.05) and malondialdehyde (SMD: 1.34, 95% CI: 0.30 to 2.39) were significantly higher, and vitamins A (SMD: -0.66, 95% CI -1.14 to -0.17) and E (SMD: -0.74, 95% CI: -1.28 to -0.20), beta-carotene (SMD: -1.80, 95% CI: -2.92 to -0.67), lutein (SMD: -1.52, 95% CI: -1.83 to -1.20) and albumin (SMD: -0.98, 95% CI: -1.68 to -0.27) were significantly lower in the plasma or serum of people with CF versus controls. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis found good evidence for reduced antioxidant capacity and elevated oxidative stress in people with clinically-stable CF.

In this paper, we focus on an application, which is launching real size soccer balls with a size constrained robot. As the size of the actuator cannot be increased, kicking strength can only be improved by enhancing electrical to mechanical energy conversion, compared to existing systems. For this, we propose to modify its inner structure, splitting the coil and the energy storage capacitor into several ones, and triggering the coils successively for propagating the magnetic force in order to improve efficiency. This article first presents a model of reluctance electromagnetic coil guns using a coupled electromagnetic, electrical and mechanical models. Four different coil gun structures are then simulated, concluding that splitting the kicking coil into two half size ones is the best trade-off for optimizing energy transfer, while maintaining an acceptable system complexity and controllability. This optimization results in robust enhancement and leads to an increase by <mml:semantics>104%</mml:semantics> of the energy conversion compared to a reference launcher used. This result has been validated experimentally on our RoboCup robots. This paper also proves that splitting the coil into a higher number of coils is not an interesting trade-off. Beyond results on the chosen case study, this paper presents an optimization technique based on mixed mechanic, electric and electromagnetic modelling that can be applied to any reluctance coil gun.

Methods: We designed a semi-automatic segmentation pipeline of individual leg muscles in MR images based on automatic propagation through nonlinear registrations of initial delineation in a minimal number of MR slices. This approach has been validated for the segmentation of individual muscles from MRI data sets, acquired over a 10-month period, from thighs and legs in 10 patients with muscular dystrophy. The robustness of the framework was evaluated using conventional metrics related to muscle volume and clinical metrics related to fat infiltration. Results: High accuracy of the semi-automatic segmentation (mean Dice similarity coefficient higher than 0.89) was reported. The provided method has excellent reliability regarding the reproducibility of the fat fraction estimation, with an average intraclass correlation coefficient score of 0.99. Furthermore, the present segmentation framework was determined to be more reliable than the intra-expert performance, which had an average intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93. Conclusion: The proposed framework of segmentation can successfully provide an effective and reliable tool for accurate follow-up of any MRI biomarkers in neuromuscular disorders. This method could assist the quantitative assessment of muscular changes occurring in such diseases.

Diatomite was heated up to 550, 750 or 950 degrees C to modify its physico-chemical and binding properties. A thorough characterization of the resulting material was done by X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), ThermoGravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and porosity measurements. The adsorption of nickel and silver ions onto these materials was studied as a function of the adsorbent concentration, organic matter as well as the presence of competitor ions. Diatomites demonstrated a better retention capacity when compared to materials of close composition. Best removal capability was obtained by calcination at 550 degrees C. This material was successfully tested for nickel and silver removal from both natural river waters as well as industrial wastewater. Due to high regeneration and reusability, this low cost, easily prepared, natural material may be an attractive alternative for adsorbent in wastewaters treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The marine strain, Shewanella woodyi MS32 has been identified as a luminous bacterium. Very little information is known on this bacterium, in particular if its luminescence and biofilm formation are controlled by QS. In this study, we have demonstrated that S. woodyi MS32 emits luminescence in planktonic and sessile conditions. The putative QS regulatory genes homologous to luxI and luxR identified in the S. woodyi MS32 genome, named swoI and swoR, are divergently transcribed and are not genetically linked to the lux operon in contrast with its closest parent Shewanella hanedai and with Aliivibrio fischeri. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis based on the SwoI and SwoR sequences shows that a separate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurred for the regulatory genes and for the lux operon. Functional analyses demonstrate that the swoI and swoR mutants were non-luminescent. Expression of lux genes was impaired in the QS regulatory mutants. N-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C-8-HSL) identified using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in the wild-type strain (but not in Delta swoI) can induce S. woodyi luminescence. No significant difference has been detected between the wild-type and mutants on adhesion and biofilm formation in the conditions tested. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the luxCDABEG genes of S. woodyi MS32 are involved in luminescence emission and that the swoR/swoI genes, originated from a separate HGT, regulate luminescence through C-8-HSL production.

These organisms play a pivotal role in the ecosystem as prey of top predators and as predators of low-trophic-level organisms. Although shipboard-ADCP (acoustic Doppler current profiler) acoustic backscatter signal intensity cannot provide an absolute biomass estimate, it may be a useful proxy to investigate variability in the distribution and relative density of micro-nekton. This study used acoustic recordings data spread across 19 years (1999-2017) from 54 ADCP cruises in New Caledonia's subtropical EEZ (exclusive economic zone) to assess seasonal and interannual variabilities and spatial distribution of micro-nekton. The dataset was composed of two different ADCPs: 150 kHz for the first period, followed by 75 kHz for more recent years. We examined the 20-120 m averaged scattering layer. Using the few cruises with concurrent EK60 measurements, we proposed that the backscatter from the ADCPs and 70 kHz EK60 were sufficiently closely linked to allow the use of the backscatter signal from the ADCPs in a combined dataset over the full time series. We then designed a GAMM (generalized additive mixed model) model that takes into account the two ADCP devices as well as temporal variability. After accounting for the effect of the devices, we showed that the acoustic signal was mainly driven by diel vertical migration, season, year, and ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation). In a second step, a consensus model between two statistical approaches (GAMM and SVM) (support vector machine) was constructed, linking the nighttime 20-120 m backscatter to the oceanographic and geographic environment. This model showed that sea surface temperature was the main factor driving backscatter variability in the EEZ, with intensified backscatter during the austral summer (December to May) in the northern part of the EEZ. We showed that acoustic density differed significantly, spatially and temporally from micronekton biomass predicted for the same period by the SEAPODYM-MTL (mid-trophic level) ecosystem model. The seasonal cycle given by ADCP data lagged behind the SEAPODYM-MTL seasonal cycle by around three months. Reasons to explain these differences and further needs in observation and modeling were explored in the discussion. In addition to providing new insights for micronekton dynamics in this EEZ (i.e., the science needed for ecosystem-based fisheries management), the data should help improve our ability to model this key trophic component.

This paper presents a new approach for an efficient DT representation by addressing the following novel concepts. First, a model of moment volumes is introduced as an effective pre-processing technique for enriching the robust and discriminative information of dynamic voxels with low computational cost. Second, two important extensions of Local Derivative Pattern operator are proposed to improve its performance in capturing directional features. Third, we present a new framework, called Momental Directional Patterns, taking into account the advantages of filtering and local-feature-based approaches to form effective DT descriptors. Furthermore, motivated by convolutional neural networks, the proposed framework is boosted by utilizing more global features extracted from max-pooling videos to improve the discrimination power of the descriptors. Our proposal is verified on benchmark datasets, i.e., UCLA, DynTex, and DynTex++, for DT classification issue. The experimental results substantiate the interest of our method.

Animal manures were collected from corresponding farms, sieved through 2 mm mesh, mixed with sea sand at a ratio of 1:1 w/w using distilled water, and transferred to transparent plastic cups containing a cathode and an anode connected together. Fifty cups were serially connected to form an environmental battery. The study demonstrated that direct use of animal manure for electricity generation produced electricity with high-voltage and current that, after 96 h of installation, was higher than previously published studies. The study revealed the effects of sunlight, temperature and manure sterilization on electricity generation. The environmental battery has a life of 40-60 days of sustainable electricity generation with the following order: horse manure > chicken manure > cow manure > sludge. In conclusion it is an advantageous option to produce electricity from animal manure as a cheap resource.

This in-vasive species produces saxitoxin, which causes the paralytic shellfish poisoning syndrome in humans upon consumption of contaminated seafood. Blooms of A. pacificum have been reported in metal-contaminated coastal ecosystems, suggesting some ability of these microorganisms to adapt to and/or resist in metal stress conditions. This study seeks to characterize the modifications in membrane proteomes (by 2-D electrophoresis coupled to LC-MS/MS), cell growth and morphometry (measured with an inverted microscope), in response to metal stress (addition of Zn2+,Pb2+,Cu2+ and Cd2+), in two Mediterranean A pacOcum strains: SG C10-3 and TAR C5-4F, re-spectively isolated from the Santa Giusta Lagoon (Sardinia, Italy) and from the Tarragona seaport (Spain), both metal-contaminated ecosystems. In the SG C10-3 cultures grown in a metal cocktail, cell growth was significantly delayed, and cell size increased (22% of 37.5 mu m cells after 25 days of growth). Conversely, no substantial change was observed for cell growth or cell size in the TAR C5-4F cultures grown in a metal cocktail (P> 0.10), thus in-dicating intraspecific variability in the responses of A. pacificum strains to metal contamination. Regardless of the conditions tested, the total number of proteins constituting the membrane proteome was significantly higher for TAR C5-4F than for SG C10-3, which may help TAR C5-4F to thrive better in contaminated conditions. For both strains, the total number of proteins constituting the membrane proteomes was significantly lower in response to metal stress (29% decrease in the SG C10-3 proteome: 82 +/- 12 proteins for controls, and 58 +/- 12 in metalcontaminated cultures; 17% decrease in the TAR C5-4F proteome: 101 +/- 8 proteins for controls, and 84 +/- 5 in metal-contaminated cultures). Moreover, regardless of the strain, proteins with significantly modified expression in response to stress were mainly down-regulated (representing 45% of the proteome for SG C10-3 and 38% for TAR C5-4F), dearly showing the harmful effects of the metals. Protein down-regulation may affect cell transport (actin and phospholipid scramblase in SG C10-3), photosynthesis (RUBISCO in SG C10-3, light-harvesting protein in TAR C5-4F, and high-CO2-inducing periplasmic protein in both strains), and finally energy metabolism (ATP synthase in both strains). However, other modifications in protein expression may confer to these A. pacificum strains a capacity for adaptation and/or resistance to metal stress conditions, for example by (i) limiting the metal entry through the plasma membrane of the SG C10-3 cells (via the down-regulation of scramblase) and/or (ii) reducing the oxidative stress generated by metals in SG C10-3 and TAR C5-4F cells (due to down-regulation of ATP-synthase).

The objectives of the present study were to characterize the fluorescence signal of anthropogenic effluent DOM from wastewater treatment plant and to evaluate the effect of solar irradiation on the fluorescence signal in the coastal zone. Solar irradiation experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect photochemical degradation using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) method combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Results showed high fluorescence of DOM before irradiation and the intensity tends to decrease after 4th and 15th day of irradiation. Rapid photochemical degradation of humic-like fluorophores and appearance of a post-irradiance dominant anthropogenic effluent DOM fluorophores were also observed after irradiation. Our experiments showed a sharp reduction in fluorescence intensity which occurred after 4th day of solar irradiation and the fluorescence signal did not disappeared after 15th day indicating the formation of a specific signal due to solar irradiation. PARAFAC model divided the bulk EEM spectra into three individual fluorescent components with C1 "terrestrial humic-like" and C2 "humic-like of longer wavelength" and C3 is a noisy component with two emission maxima. Multilinear regression of PARAFAC components contribution with mixing composition was most suitable according to the equation C*i = A(i,0)(WW) + A(i,1)(WW).f(SW) + A(i,2)(WW).f(RW), where C*(i) is the normalized contribution of PARAFAC component number i in a given irradiation day; A(i,0)(WW), A(i,1)(WW), A(i,2)(WW) are the multilinear regression coefficients and contain implicitly the effect of f(WW); and WW, SW, and RW are treated wastewater, sea water, and river water respectively. The values of A(i,0)(WW), A(i,1)(WW), and A(i,2)(WW) fitted second-order kinetics with irradiation process with kinetic constant of 9.68, - 987.35, and - 977.67 respectively for C1 equation and the same trend for C2 and no values for C3 due to its noisy character indicating the rapid degradation with increase of f(SW) and f(RW) and the predominance of the residual fluorescence coming from f(WW) which is the content fraction of anthropogenic effluent DOM because A(i,0)(WW) was 100 times less sensitive to photobleaching.

Fish farms constitute a source of organic matter and nutrients (food and fecal pellets) that causes the extirpation of Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows beneath and near to farm facilities. In addition to direct effects, the nitrogen enrichment of macrophytes tissues increases the grazing pressure by herbivorous fishes and sea urchins. In some cases, the impact can continue to increase several years after the cessation of farming activities. Natural restoration of extirpated seagrass meadows is generally unlikely at the human time scale. Shellfish aquaculture is the cause of the main flow of introduced macrophytes in the Mediterranean; the main vector is the importation of oyster spat from Japan and Korea. North-eastern Pacific seaweeds are now the dominant biotic component of some Mediterranean lagoons (e.g., Thau, Mar Piccolo, and Venice lagoons). In addition to direct effects, mussel aquaculture can constitute a source of larvae that flow with currents, the adults of which can overwhelm seaweed forests (e.g., Carpodesmia mediterranea). Shellfish aquaculture is also a source of fecal pellets, resulting in changes in bottom macrophytes, and a vector of diseases of metazoans, the extirpation of which may change the functioning of recipient macrophyte ecosystems. The edible sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus is sometimes erroneously considered as in decline due to over-harvesting. However, its abundance in the second half of the 20th century was probably a consequence of human impact (overfishing of its predatory fish, organic pollution. This man-induced proliferation resulted in the extirpation of seaweed forests (e.g., Carpodesmia spp., Treptacantha spp. - formerly Cystoseira spp. - Sargassum spp.; many species are endemic), which play a key role in Mediterranean coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the attempts to restore sea urchin abundance, via seeding of juveniles from hatcheries, has further artificialized the habitats rather than contributing to the restoration of natural ecosystems. Good practices guidelines are proposed aimed at minimizing the impact of aquaculture on macrophytes.

Thermodynamic analysis of the classical lattice-hole model of liquids								JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS				534						119942	10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2020.119942			APR 15 2020	2020	A complete thermodynamic analysis of the classical 2-parameter lattice-hole model of liquids is presented. To our knowledge, no such analysis was available before. It is shown that the model depicts a van der Waals like behavior. The calculated phase diagram features a coexistence line between a condensed and a gas phases ending at a critical point. The model is not able to describe a transition between two condensed phases such as melting. Model parametrization to simulate an archetypal fragile glass forming liquid, the ortho-terphenyl, reveals an only qualitative/semi-quantitative agreement with available experimental information. The extreme simplicity of this 2-parameter model restricts its ability to describe a real liquid. Taking into account the existence of a volume difference between a hole and a molecule, inserting a temperature and pressure dependencies of the physical parameters and allowing the energy parameter to depend on the hole concentration are the most promising modeling options.

Total and partial oxidation reactions were observed in the temperature range between 600 and 750 degrees C under CH4/dry air flux, for low CH4 concentrations. The electrical conduction mechanism is based on electron tunneling at low temperature (< 650 degrees C) and hopping over an ion barrier at high temperature, which favors the catalytic oxidation of CH4 in air; these mechanisms occur during the partial and total oxidation under weak gas flow. The occurrence of these types of conduction mechanism was related both to the distorted monoclinic structure of Ce-2(WO4)(3) and to the larger structural cavities, as evidenced respectively by X-ray diffraction analyses (Rietveld analyses) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The oxidation state of cerium is 3 + in the compound, as revealed by XPS investigations.

Cytometric pulse shapes derived from optical features of single cells allowed the characterization of eight phytoplankton groups. Abundance and total red fluorescence (chlorophyll a auto-fluorescence) per group were used to define six phytoplankton communities. Their distribution revealed high spatial heterogeneity. Abundance presented a longitudinal gradient for six over the eight groups and succession of brutal shifts along the cruise. Maximum values were often located near the Ushant front in the Western English Channel. A latitudinal gradient characterised the Central English Channel waters under the influence of the Seine estuary. Picophytoplankton (Syrzechocoecus-like cells and picoeukaryotes) represented up to 96% of total abundance and half of the total red fluorescence of the communities near the main front and the Bay of Seine, whereas nanoeukaryotes and microphytoplankton, represented only 4% and less than 1% respectively of total abundance. Both nanoeukaryotes and microphytoplankton dominated the total red fluorescence of the communities of the Central English Channel. The study of traits within each group showed a high variability of traits between communities. The comparison between traits showed that they were independent from each other for some groups (size and red fluorescence per cell for PicoHighFLR and Coccolithophore-like cells; orange and red fluorescence for all the groups), whereas they were dependent for other groups (red fluorescence per cell was dependent of size for picophytoplankton, NanoLowFLR, NanoHighFLR, Cryptophyte-like cells and Micro-phytoplankton). Variance partitioning revealed that the environmental parameters (temperature, salinity and turbidity) accounted less than spatial descriptors (physical and biological processes) in shaping the communities. Hydrological structures (frontal structures, eddies and tidal streams) were responsible for patches of phyto-plankton and defined the structure at the sub-mesoscale (1-10 km) in this area.

Mechanical, electronic and topological properties of CuInSe2/AlP heterostructures along the [001] direction were investigated using the full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method. Optimal interfacial distance, thermodynamic stability and band alignment have been computed systematically. A heterointerface with "on-top" stacking is thermodynamically the most stable compared with other stackings. The magnitudes of core level binding energy differences are in accordance with interfacial adhesion energies. Absolute deformation potentials (ADPs) of band energies as a function of (001) biaxial strain were determined. With redressing of ADPs, the revised valence and conduction band offsets have increased and decreased, respectively. AlP has strong resistance to biaxial strain in the evolution of band energy edges. Topological properties and density of states were used to investigate the relationship between interatomic interactions and energy band evolution. The most stable CuInSe2/AlP heterostructures have "spike-like" band offsets, with the one terminated as Se-Al characterized by a flat conduction band offset of 12 meV. This comes from the strong "Cu d-Se p" states hybridization. The theoretical maximum conversion efficiency of the AlP-based "absorber-buffer" heterostructure is 27.39% at 0.5 mu m thickness.

Our study shows that this physics imposes design rules for the intersubband transition. We develop an analytical model that correctly treats, from a quantum point of view, the trade-off between the absorption, the recombination, and the electronic transport occurring in this transition. Our results clearly indicate that it is essential to control the transit rate between the excited state of the quantum dot and the embedding semiconductor. For that, we propose assuming the dot in a tunnel shell whose main characteristics can be obtained by a simple analytical formula. Moreover, we show that in a realistic case, the energy transition needs to be larger than only 0.27 eV to obtain a quasi-Fermi-level-splitting. This quite small value designates the quantum-dot solar cell as a serious candidate to be an efficient intermediate-band solar cell. This work gives a framework to design efficient intersubband transitions and opens new opportunities for quantum-dot intermediate-band solar cells.

HFR technology is widely acknowledged as a cost-efficient tool to monitor coastal regions and has potential use to monitor coastal regions all over the world. Globally, the number of HFR stations is steadily increasing. Regional networks provide real-time data in support of operational activities such as search and rescue operations, fast response in case of maritime accidents and spill of pollutants, and resource management. Each operator needs a general understanding of the working principles in order to ensure that instruments are managed properly. A set of harmonized quality assurance and quality control procedures is recommended, along with an effective approach to HFR data discovery and dissemination, to provide high quality measurements to the end users. Different documents providing best practices for operation and maintenance have emerged in the past years. They are oriented either to Direction Finding (DF) or Beam Forming (BF) systems, or to specific manufacturer's radar systems. The main objective of this paper is to offer a comprehensive "Best Practices" document in an effort of ensuring consistency between different deployments and harmonized operations of HFR systems. This, regardless of system manufacturer, antenna design and setup. A homogeneous approach is given when possible, general concepts and definitions are introduced in order to provide a framework for both data processing and management steps. Examples are also given from the European HFR users with focus on Near Real Time data flow suitable for operational services.

In Southeast Asia, tropical peatlands are being rapidly deforested and drained. The blackwater rivers draining these peatland areas have high concentrations of DOM and the potential to be hotspots for CO2 release. However, the fate of this fluvial carbon export is uncertain, and its role as a trace metal carrier has never been investigated. This work aims to address these gaps in our understanding of tropical peatland DOM and associated elements in the context of degraded tropical peatlands in Indonesian Borneo. We quantified dissolved organic carbon and trace metal concentrations in the dissolved and fine colloidal (< 0.22 mu m) and coarse colloidal (0.22-2.7 mu m) fractions and determined the characteristics (delta C-13, absorbance, fluorescence. excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor - PARAFAC - analysis) of the peatland-derived DOM as it drains from peatland canals, flows along the Ambawang River (blackwater river) and eventually mixes with the Kapuas Kecil River (whitewater river) before meeting the ocean near the city of Pontianak in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We observe downstream shifts in indicators of in-stream processing. An increase in the delta C-13 of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), along with an increase in the C1/C2 ratio of PARAFAC fluorophores, and a decrease in SUVA (specific UV absorbance) along the continuum suggest the predominance of photo-oxidation. However, very low dissolved oxygen concentrations also suggest that oxygen is quickly consumed by microbial degradation of DOM in the shallow layers of water. Blackwater rivers draining degraded peatlands show significantly higher concentrations of Al, Fe, Pb, As, Ni and Cd compared to the whitewater river. A strong association is observed between DOM, Fe, As, Cd and Zn in the dissolved and fine colloid fraction, while Al is associated with Pb and Ni and present in a higher proportion in the coarse colloidal fraction. We additionally measured the isotopic composition of lead released from degraded tropical peatlands for the first time and show that Pb originates from anthropogenic atmospheric deposition. Degraded tropical peatlands are important sources of DOM and trace metals to rivers and a secondary source of atmospherically deposited contaminants.

Methods MRI fat fraction was assessed in lower-limb musculature of patients with CMT1A and healthy controls. More particularly, 14 muscle compartments were selected at leg and thigh levels and for proximal, distal, and medial slices. Muscle fat infiltration profile was determined quantitatively in each muscle compartment and along the entire volume of acquisition to determine a length-dependent gradient of fat infiltration. Clinical impairment was evaluated with muscle strength measurements and CMT Examination Scores (CMTESs). Results A total of 16 patients with CMT1A were enrolled and compared to 11 healthy controls. Patients with CMT1A showed a larger muscle fat fraction at leg and thigh levels with a proximal-to-distal gradient. At the leg level, the largest fat infiltration was quantified in the anterior and lateral compartments. CMTES was correlated with fat fraction, especially in the anterior compartment of leg muscles. Strength of plantar flexion was also correlated with fat fraction of the posterior compartments of leg muscles. Conclusion On the basis of quantitative MRI measurements combined with a dedicated segmentation method, muscle fat infiltration quantified in patients with CMT1A disclosed a length-dependent peroneal-type pattern of fat infiltration and was correlated to main clinical variables. Quantification of fat fraction at different levels of the leg anterior compartment might be of interest in future clinical trials.

Thus, frictional behaviour can be accurately controlled in real time by using thermally sensitive periodic patterned self-assembled monolayers of n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) grafted on MEMS surfaces. Nanopatterns are currently used in order to limit the wear rate without modifying the frictional behaviour. In this work, patterns have been created by micro-contact printing (mu CP) using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp displaying a trapezoidal profile. Hence, pattern periodicity can be continuously changed-and then optimized from discontinuous to pseudo-continuous-by applying a controlled normal load on the soft PDMS stamp. A multiscale tribological study has been carried out on these nanopatterns by using both single-asperity and multi-asperity nanotribometers. Lateral force microscopy (LFM) provides the individual frictional behaviour of each pattern's component, whereas the multi-asperity nanotribometer rather gives the emerging frictional behaviour induced by the patterning according to temperature. As a macroscopic crucial parameter while designing TENG's devices, this macroscopic behaviour has to be carefully optimized for each practical applications at the molecular scale. Thus, the microscale frictional behaviour can be precisely optimized by the pattern's periodicity, whereas the macroscopic one can be accurately controlled with values of friction coefficient ranging from 0.12 to 0.04 by varying the contact temperature. In addition, any inertial effects observed in the thermal-controlled frictional behaviour of nanopatterns can be drastically reduced using infra-red emission as thermal source.

Using a methodology based on generalized estimation equation models and social data from the Vigeo Eiris longitudinal database (2004-2015), the study shows that the economic system, in the sense of Amable, and the industrial sector have the greatest influence on CSP and its dimensions.

We redress this here using archived samples, collected during January-February 1993 along a transect from Cape Town to the South African National Antarctic Expedition (SANAE) base in Antarctica, and compare the patterns generated with those determined from a prior analysis of whole assemblages at lower taxonomic resolution. Twenty-one species were identified from 18 of the original 53 samples collected, and two distinct assemblages were confirmed as separated by the Sub-Antarctic Front. That to the south was characterised by low diversity and high abundance and was dominated by cold-water specialists, whereas that to the north comprised a larger number of subtropical and temperate species at low abundance. Assemblage structure was strongly influenced by the mixed layer depth, sea surface salinity and chlorophyllaconcentration, as well as mesozooplankton biomass. Congruence with the whole-assemblage study was high, indicating that this taxon can be suitably employed as a proxy in studies such as this. The study emphasises the value of archived plankton samples and makes a plea for better curation.		[Kuyper, D.; Gibbons, M.

Beta diversity of pelagic assemblages at fish aggregating devices in the open ocean								AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				42	2			247	254		10.2989/1814232X.2020.1774804			APR 2 2020	2020	Owing to difficulties in accessing the vast open ocean, the beta (beta) diversity of pelagic fish assemblages remains poorly studied. We investigated the relationship between assemblage similarity and geographical distance between anchored fish aggregating devices (FADs), sampled by standardised underwater visual censuses in three anchored FAD arrays in the Indian Ocean-at the Maldives, the Seychelles and Mauritius. The use of two complementary indices of beta-diversity, based on presence/absence data (Jaccard similarity coefficient) and abundance data (Bray-Curtis index), revealed that geographical distance between sampling sites (from 4 to 257 km) appeared to have no effect on the similarity of fish assemblages associated with FADs within each array. The results of this preliminary study question the generalisation of the paradigm of an increase in beta-diversity with geographic distance to the open-ocean fish community. Large-scale studies using a variety of datasets should be conducted to further investigate patterns of beta-diversity in the open ocean.

The polycrystalline compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and photoluminescence (PL) experiments. Using the Rietveld procedure, the decrease in cell parameters showed that a solid solution was obtained. A comparative analysis of diffraction profiles allowed determining structural distortions increasing with increasing composition x. The PL experiments were performed under UV and XR excitations. The variations with composition x of emission intensities observed in the wavelength range of 500-1000 nm, corresponding to complex charge transfers (CTs) and quenching effects, were interpreted in terms of transitions proper to Ce3+ and Sm3+ cations, accompanied by additional transitions due to oxygen vacancies and other point defects due to substitution and synthesis conditions.

A critical review of the N-15(2) tracer method to measure diazotrophic production in pelagic ecosystems								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS				18	4			129	147		10.1002/lom3.10353			APR 2020	2020	Dinitrogen (N-2) fixation is an important source of biologically reactive nitrogen (N) to the global ocean. The magnitude of this flux, however, remains uncertain, in part because N-2 fixation rates have been estimated following divergent protocols and because associated levels of uncertainty are seldom reported-confounding comparison and extrapolation of rate measurements. A growing number of reports of relatively low but potentially significant rates of N-2 fixation in regions such as oxygen minimum zones, the mesopelagic water column of the tropical and subtropical oceans, and polar waters further highlights the need for standardized methodological protocols for measurements of N-2 fixation rates and for calculations of detection limits and propagated error terms. To this end, we examine current protocols of the N-15(2) tracer method used for estimating diazotrophic rates, present results of experiments testing the validity of specific practices, and describe established metrics for reporting detection limits. We put forth a set of recommendations for best practices to estimate N-2 fixation rates using N-15(2) tracer, with the goal of fostering transparency in reporting sources of uncertainty in estimates, and to render N-2 fixation rate estimates intercomparable among studies.

Within the semi-enclosed Mediterranean Sea, the high number of such areas might locally challenge the persistence of coastal marine species. In recent decades, biomonitoring studies, using sentinel species such as mussels, have increased knowledge of coastal contamination and provided a number of contentious potential environmental surveillance biomarkers, which contributed to a better comprehension toward the acclimation abilities of marine organisms, to actual anthropogenically derived environments. The aim of this study was to characterize the influence of the chemically, multi-contaminated, Bay of Toulon (France) on the young fauna, using juvenile sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus as a proxy. Hatchery-produced individuals were immersed, for 1 mo, within the bay, at four contrasted sites for MTE concentrations. At the end of the experiment, growth and transcript abundances of key genes, involved in the acclimation process, were assessed. Contrasted phenotypic and molecular responses were observed evidencing a significant environmental influence. Specifically, under the high metallic stress, a dwarfing response was observed, associated with a high level of metallothionein and a low level of hsp response. In addition, the level of DNA methyltransferase transcript abundance was inversely correlated with the level of MTE concentrations, highlighting that the chronic exposure to metallic contaminants would probably increase the risk of genetic mutations, such as those consecutive to transpositions. Overall, this study indicates that further in-depth research into the mechanisms driving plasticity and adaptive changes at the population level is required.

The only permanent populations are located in the Alboran Sea near the Strait of Gibraltar and the Strait of Messina (Italy). In contrast, since the early 19th century, several sightings, on ship's hulls or in harbours, reflect the dispersal of propagules which failed to establish in the Mediterranean. Here we report a new sighting of Saccorhiza polyschides, near the port of Jijel, Algeria. This first new record in the Mediterranean for more than a century indicates that the dispersal of propagules continues today. In addition, because of its spectacular size and ease of its observation, it sheds light on the expansion routes of a species at the limit of their current range area.

At present, knowledge on basic plastic particle dynamics and the interaction with complex hydrodynamics is lacking. The present laboratory study, performed under controlled wave and wind conditions, demonstrates the dispersion of plastics in shallow waters. The study presents a simple case looking solely at cross-shore particle transport. The results show that both wind and waves as well as plastic properties (shape and density) govern the behaviour of plastic litter in the nearshore zone. Heavy particles behave like natural sand with accumulation in the wave breaking zone. Light particles have varying accumulation along the coastal profile depending on the wind, waves and particle shapes. More extensive characterization remains to be done in future studies.

Long chains are used for their strong van der Waals interactions inducing good layer organization. Amine function-terminated alkyl chains are of great interest and are widely used for further surface functionalization. Since it is mandatory that such layers be organized to provide amine moieties at the surface, the present study deals with exploring amine-terminated SAM formation as an alternative to the usual aminopropylalkylsilane SAM. Additionally, using a long NH2-terminated alkyl chain allows the formation of hydrogen bonding thanks to the two NH moieties born along the chain. Furthermore, such hydrogen bonding makes possible to shorten the molecule length while preserving a well-organized monolayer. For this purpose we performed a complete study of the grafting of (3-Trimethoxysilylpropyl) diethylenetriamine (DETAS) on native silicon oxide using various solvents, relative humidity and temperature values. Grafting kinetics was monitored by ellipsometry and goniometry, and SAM structure and organization using AFM and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Hydrogen bonding was evidenced within the SAM growth process and in the final complete SAM. We believe such study enables a better control of good quality DETAS SAM in order to improve their efficiency in further surface functionalization applications.

Relation between the corrosion resistance and the chemical structure of hybrid sol-gel coatings with interlinked inorganic-organic network								PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS				141						105532	10.1016/j.porgcoat.2019.105532			APR 2020	2020	Organic-inorganic hybrid coatings have been prepared by a sol-gel route from 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) with triethylenetetramine (TETA) added in the sol formulation. The main goal of this research was to evaluate how the chemical structure of the GPTMS/TEOS/TETA hybrid coatings influences the corrosion of mild steel. The presence of TETA as an epoxy opening agent offers the possibility to form interconnected epoxy-amine and silica networks. It was found by means of Si-29 HRMAS NMR spectroscopy that TETA acted as an efficient basic catalyst for the condensation of GPTMS and TEOS. This accelerates the gelation and gives limited shelf life to GPTMS/TEOS/TETA sols. Structural characterization of the cured hybrid coatings was performed using C-13 and Si-29 Solid State NMR spectroscopies. The results show that the epoxy amine reaction is the principal epoxide ring opening reaction. The slow formation of diol units with sols prepared with an excess of epoxy groups has also been observed. It was found that the polymerization of the organic network hindered the polymerization of the siloxane network. As a result, the film based on an epoxy rich off-stoichiometric formulation had a higher Persoz hardness value compared to the stoichiometric film. The corrosion behavior of the coatings in neutral chloride solution was studied through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results revealed that barrier properties have been improved by the addition of TETA to sol-gel films. The films based on epoxy rich off-stoichiometric formulation and those base on stoichiometric formulation resulted in similar barrier properties but a higher resistance to interfacial delamination was observed for the epoxy rich off-stoichiometric films. The relationship between the film structure and its corrosion behavior was discussed.		[Perrin, F.

The twinned NWs show higher yield strength than the single-crystalline NWs with similar diameter. Postmortem observations using electron microscopy and MD simulations show that the presence of CTBs transitions the governing mechanism from twinning-mediated deformation in single-crystalline NWs to strongly localized deformation. MD simulations reveal that the intersection of deposited partial dislocations at the CTB with the free surfaces plays an important role in the transmission of the dislocation, leading to the formation of full dislocations instead of partial dislocations and twinning in the case of single-crystalline NWs. The repeated activation of full dislocation slip leading to localized deformation is furthermore dependent on the relative orientation of surface facets to the activated Burgers vectors. The results of this work enhance the understanding of deformation mechanisms of twinned nano-objects and suggest design strategies for mechanical systems at the nanoscale.

We first consider monomodal logics, which contain only Necessity or Possibility. We then consider the more important case of bimodal logics, which contain both modal operators. In this case we define several interactions between Necessity and Possibility of increasing strength, although weaker than duality. We thereby obtain a lattice of 24 distinct bimodal logics. For all logics we provide both a Hilbert axiomatisation and a cut-free sequent calculus, on its basis we also prove their decidability. We then define a semantic characterisation of our logics in terms of neighbourhood models containing two distinct neighbourhood functions corresponding to the two modalities. Our semantic framework captures modularly not only our systems but also already known intuitionistic non-normal modal logics such as Constructive K (CK) and the propositional fragment of Wijesekera's Constructive Concurrent Dynamic Logic.

In this context, the present study aimed to investigate how the surface metabolome of the algal holobiont Taonia atomaria could drive epiphytic microbiota variations at the thallus scale. First, a clear discrimination was observed between algal surface, planktonic and rocky prokaryotic communities. These data strengthened the hypothesis of an active role of the algal host in the selection of epiphytic communities. Moreover, significant higher epibacterial density and alpha-diversity were found at the basal algal parts compared to the apical ones, suggesting a maturation gradient of the community along the thallus. In parallel, a multiplatform mass spectrometry-based metabolomics study, using molecular networking to annotate relevant metabolites, highlighted a clear chemical differentiation at the algal surface along the thallus with similar clustering as for microbial communities. In that respect, higher amounts of sesquiterpenes, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and diacylglycerylhydroxymethyl-N,N,N-trimethyl-beta-alanines (DGTAs) were observed at the apical regions while dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and carotenoids were predominantly found at the basal parts of the thalli. A weighted UniFrac distance-based redundancy analysis linking the metabolomics and metabarcoding datasets indicated that these surface compounds, presumably of algal origin, may drive the zonal variability of the epibacterial communities. As only few studies were focused on microbiota and metabolome variation along a single algal thallus, these results improved our understanding about seaweed holobionts. Through this multi-omics approach at the thallus scale, we suggested a plausible scenario where the chemical production at the surface of T. atomaria, mainly induced by the algal physiology, could explain the specificity and the variations of the surface microbiota along the thallus.

Both robots are equipped with standard low-cost sensors: cameras, depth sensor and inertial measurement unit (IMU). This work introduces an innovative visual servoing control scheme based on a parameterized catenary model of the tether, assuming that it is negatively buoyant The tether is detected in the image through color segmentation and its 3-D shape parameters are estimated through a nonlinear optimization procedure thanks to an adapted Gauss-Newton algorithm. Simulations and experimental results show that the relative positioning of the robots can be achieved through simultaneous tether shape visual servoing in both leader and follower's cameras, even in situations of tether partial visibility and strong disturbances, which proves the approach to be reliable.

Hydrothermal carbonization of sugarcane industry byproducts (bagasse and vinasse) in the presence and absence of H3PO4 afforded HLS, which were isolated and compared with humic substances (HS) isolated from ADE in terms of molecular composition and maize seed germination activity. HLS isolated from sugarcane bagasse hydrochar produced in the presence or absence of H3PO4 comprised both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, differing from other HLS mainly in terms of phenolic content, while HLS isolated from vinasse hydrochar featured hydrophobic structures mainly comprising aliphatic moieties. Compared to that of HLS, the structure of soil-derived HS reflected an increased contribution of fresh organic matter input and, hence, featured a higher content of O-alkyl moieties. HLS derived from lignocellulosic biomass were rich in phenolics and promoted maize seed germination more effectively than HLS comprising alkyl moieties. Thus, HLS isolated from bagasse hydrochar had the highest bioactivity, as the presence of amphiphilic moieties therein seemed to facilitate the release of bioactive molecules from supramolecular structures and stimulate seed germination. Based on the above results, the hydrothermal carbonization of lignocellulosic biomass was concluded to be a viable method of producing amphiphilic HLS for use as plant growth promoters.

J	Ayadi, Kafia; Muratore, Isabelle								Digimums' online grocery shopping: the end of children's influence?								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT				48	4			348	362		10.1108/IJRDM-09-2019-0291			MAR 17 2020	2020	Purpose This paper investigates children's influence on their mothers' online grocery shopping. As virtual shopping does not provide instant gratification, the authors explore how children between the ages of 7 and 11 are involved in the online purchasing process (before, during and after the purchase) with their digital mothers (digimums). Design/methodology/approach We collected qualitative data from 27 separate semi-structured interviews of mothers and their children. Findings Children's influence during the online buying process exists and can be active, passive and/or proactive. The findings extend knowledge about children's influence by adding the notion of proactive influence where children use an intended approach to anticipate their mother's needs for grocery shopping and take initiatives. Children use less impulsive requests and become smart shoppers using more rational arguments to explain their requests. The online buying process contributes to children's online socialisation: They learn the importance of the shopping list, prices, discounts, brands and so on. Online socialisation at home might take the physical form of using digital devices (i.e. scanning) and entering the credit card code, which contributes to the children's learning. Originality/value Online buying virtualises children's relationship to objects, and the screen acts as a kind of filter. This makes their influence strategy less emotional and corporeal and more rational (smart shopper).

To do so, the current study included 8 postmenopausal women (whose ages ranged between 65 and 84 years) with sarcopenia and 60 age-matched controls (with normal skeletal muscle mass index (SMI)). Body composition and bone parameters were evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Results Weight, lean mass, body mass index, femoral neck cross-sectional area (FN CSA), FN section modulus (Z), FN cross sectional moment of inertia (CSMI), intertrochanteric (IT) CSA, IT Z, IT CSMI, IT cortical thickness (CT), femoral shaft (FS) CSA, FS Z and FS CSMI were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in women with normal SMI compared to women with sarcopenia. In the whole population, SMI was positively associated with IT CSA, IT Z, IT CSMI, IT CT, FS CSA, FS Z, FS CSMI, FS CT but negatively correlated to IT buckling ratio (BR) and FS BR. Conclusion The current study suggests that sarcopenia has a negative effect on hip bone strength indices in postmenopausal women.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				707						135949	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135949			MAR 10 2020	2020	Sterilization techniques are largely employed to distinguish biotic and abiotic processes in biogeochemical studies as they inhibit microbial activity. Since one century, chemical sterilizers, supposed to preserve original environmental samples, have taken precedence over physical sterilization techniques considered too destructive. Sodium azide (NaN3) is nowadays the most commonly used inorganic chemical sterilizer. It is sufficiently purified to study trace metals, as well. Nevertheless, its (in)activity in physico-chemical processes was never ascertained. Through the investigation of sediment resuspension in seawater, the present work unequivocally demonstrated that NaN3 can impact carbon and tracemetals' transfers by altering the redox balance and pH. Unlike decades of blind practice, NaN3 should be used with great care to track abiotic processes from organic matter rich and reductive matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Residential mobility is studied at the level of the 304 metropolitanzones d'emploi, which is a very narrow spatial level of analysis taking into account worker's commutes, local productive specializations and the spatial dimensions of the local labor markets. The paper shows, first, that when living in a zone with a high proportion of immigrants, an immigrant is less eager to move elsewhere. Second, the location decisions of settled immigrants who relocate do not exhibit path dependence: the immigrants do not move to zones where other immigrants cluster. The paper also provides evidence that newcomers tend to locate to areas with low real estate prices and a high percentage of immigrant households within the local population. This is an original study of the locational behavior of migrants based on ethnic origin; it shows that the presence of other immigrants with the same or different ethnic origin affects the location decision of newcomers.

The Schrodinger-Newton (SN) group introduced in Duval and Lazzarini (2015 Class. Quantum Grav. 32 175006) as the maximal group of invariance of the SN equation, turns out to be also the group of conformal Bargmann automorphisms preserving the coupled Levy-Leblond and NC gravitational field equations. Within the Bargmann geometry a generalization of the LLN equation is provided as well. The canonical projective unitary representation of the SN group on fourcomponent spinors is also presented. In particular, when restricted to dilations, the value of the dynamical exponent z = (n + 2)/3 is recovered as previously derived in Duval and Lazzarini (2015 Class. Quantum Grav. 32 175006) for the SN equation. Subsequently, conserved quantities associated to the (generalized) LLN equation are also exhibited.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH				27	14			16528	16538		10.1007/s11356-020-08152-1			MAY 2020	2020	17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), the female contraceptive pill, has been detected in mediterranean coasts where seahorse populations, Hippocampus guttulatus, live. Low environmental concentrations have the potential to disrupt growth but also endocrine metabolism, and this imbalance is all the more critical in early life stage. To investigate the impact of EE2 in reared seahorses, we exposed aged 2 months and sexually undifferentiated seahorses to an environmental concentration of 21 ng/L of EE2 for a period of 30 days. EE2 exposure led to a 19% reduction in weight, but also a mortality rate of 27%. This exposure predicted demasculinization of male individuals with a late onset of secondary sexual characteristics. EE2 exposure led to an increase of the free androgen index, but significant reductions of estradiol and testosterone in males were observed. This low estrogen concentration seemed to impact the positive feedback on luteinizing hormone (LH) with a decrease in LH production. Added to this, synthetic estrogen had a negative impact on the production and the release of follicle-stimulating hormone. Contrary to all expectations, females demonstrated a significant decrease in vitellogenin, following exposure to EE2 at 21 ng/L, while no changes were detected in males. This first study on the European long-snouted seahorses confirmed the deleterious impact of the female contraceptive pill with a real impact on growth, sexual differentiation, and maturation in young immature seahorses.

In order to study the impact of monomers on the MIPs properties, various monomers such as acrylic acid (AA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), methacrylic acid (MAA) and itaconic acid (IA) in their combinations were crosslinked with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) in the presence of a complex phyto-extract template derived from Hypericum perforatum L. The synthesized MIPs and corresponding non-imprinted polymers NIPs were characterized by infrared spectroscopy analysis, morphology and thermogravimetric analysis. High-performance liquid chromatography combined with UV-Visible spectroscopy, used to investigate the recognition properties of the MIPs for various naphthodianthrones, pointed out that the MIP IA-AA system seemed to be the most adequate for favoring quantitative rebinding of proto-hypericin and proto-pseudohypericin against competitors with similar structures, like hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are usually present in high quantities in the primary Hypericum perforatum L. phyto-extracts.

In these soils, metal tolerant bacteria may play a role in plant adaptation to the edaphic constraints. Recently, two new bacteria species belonging to the genus Burkholderia sensu lato were isolated from rhizospheric roots of pioneer plant growing in New Caledonian ultramafic soils and were able to tolerate high metal concentrations. The purpose of this study was to determine the major mechanisms by which these two bacteria were able to tolerate metals and if they were able to reduce metal absorption by plants from which they were isolated. Bioaccumulation, adsorption on cell surface, ability to form biofilm and production of exopolysaccharides were assessed. A focus was carried out on Ni, generally the most toxic metal in New Caledonian ultramafic soils. All experiments were performed in comparison with a reference strain isolated from a non-ultramafic habitat, Paraburkholderia caribensis MWAP64(T). The two ultramafic bacterial species showed a high tolerance to Ni with a Ni-IC50 of 5 mM for Caballeronia novacaledonica STM10272(T) and 30 mM for Paraburkholderia ultramafica STM10279(T), values significantly higher than those of P. caribensis MWAP64T (2 mM). The major mechanism involved in the bacterial Ni tolerance was related to biofilm formation for C. novacaledonica STM10272(T) and to acidic exopolysaccharide production for P. ultramafica STM10279(T). Both species alleviated metal contents in roots of Tetraria comosa, an endemic pioneer herbaceous species growing on New Caledonian ultramafic soils.

Abstract This paper addresses a formation tracking problem of multiple low-cost underwater drones by implementing distributed adaptive neural network control (DANNC). It is based on a leader-follower architecture to operate in hazardous environments. First, unknown parameters of underwater vehicle dynamics, which are important requirements for real-world applications, are approximated by a neural network using a radial basis function. More specifically, those parameters are only calculated by local information, which can be obtained by an on-board camera without using an external positioning system. Secondly, a potential function is employed to ensure there is no collision between the underwater drones. We then propose a desired configuration of a group of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) as a time-variant function so that they can quickly change their shape between them to facilitate the crossing in a narrow area. Finally, three UUVs, based on a robot operating system (ROS) platform, are used to emphasize the realistic low-cost aspect of underwater drones. The proposed approach is validated by evaluating in different experimental scenarios.

Eight setups, associated with different combinations of the surface layer physical parameters, the land surface model, and the grid nudging parameters, were considered. Numerical simulations covered the entire month of November 2017. Model results were compared with surface data from meteorological stations. The introduction of the grid nudging parameters leads to a general improvement of the modeled 10 m wind speed and 2 m temperature. In particular, nudging of wind speed parameter inside the planetary boundary layer (PBL) provides the most remarkable differences. In contrast, the nudging of temperature and relative humidity parameters inside the PBL may be switched off to reduce computational time and data storage. Furthermore, it was shown that the prediction of the 10 m wind speed and 2 m temperature is quite sensitive to the choice of the surface layer scheme and the land surface model. This paper provides useful suggestions to improve the setup of the WRF model in the Northern Sahara and the Mediterranean basin. These results are also relevant for topics related with the emission of mineral dust and sea spray within the Mediterranean region.

To study the group dynamics of introductory physics students at the University of Helsinki, we collected network data from seven laboratory course sections of approximately 20 students each for seven consecutive weeks. The data was collected via the SocioPatterns platform, and supplemented with students' major subject, year of study and gender. We also collected the Mechanics Baseline Test to measure physics knowledge and the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey to measure attitudes. We developed metrics for studying the small networks of the laboratory sessions by using connections of the teaching assistant as a constant. In the network, we found both demographically homogeneous and heterogeneous groups that are stable. While some students are consistently loosely connected to their networks, we were not able to identify risk factors. Based on our results, the physics laboratory course is equally successful in building strongly connected groups regardless of student demographics in the sections or the formed small groups. SocioPatterns supplemented with surveys thus provides an opportunity to look into the dynamics of students' social networks.

The influence of various synthesis parameters, such as the use of distilled water or rose hip extract as reaction medium, or the percentage of the zeolite in the composite hydrogel upon the morphology, swelling kinetics and the rheological properties was investigated. By conducting polymerization of PEGDA in the rose hip extract, the crosslinking reaction yield was almost 100%, because of the chain transfer reactions of the polyphenols from the rose hip extract. Rose hip release tests were used to evaluate the release profiles of the natural bioactive substances from phytoextracts. The results showed that the hydrogel loaded with 3% zeolite displayed the lowest burst release and the slowest release rates of the extract.

Characterization and evaluation of primer formulations for bonding silicone rubber to metal								PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS				140						105513	10.1016/j.porgcoat.2019.105513			MAR 2020	2020	The aim of this study was to explore the chemistry and adhesive properties of industrial primer formulations used for bonding silicone elastomers on AA6061 aluminum alloy. The composition of different primer formulations was determined using conventional chemical analyses. Adhesion strength was measured using 90 degrees peel test. The formulation comprising partially condensed vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) and tetrapropoxysilane (TPOS) and titanium tetrabutoxide (TTB) catalyst showed a strong adhesion to metal but a low adhesive strength of the primer-elastomer interface. Si-29 NMR spectroscopy results have shown that exchange reactions of alkoxy groups of VTMS, TPOS and TTB has occurred in the formulation. Surprisingly, one formulation was free of silane and consisted of a one-component addition curing system comprising a SiH oligosiloxane, a vinyl-PDMS with a Pt catalyst and silica filler. This formulation enabled high cohesive strength of the primer and primer-elastomer interphase but it showed low adhesion to the metal. The more complex formulation containing a mixture of silanes (vinyltriethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane), a vinyl silicone gum, a hydroxyterminated PDMS and silica filler resulted in the highest adhesive strength with 100 % cohesive failure in the elastomer. We found that the reinforcement effect of silica filler plays an important role in the promotion of adhesion.		[Grard, A.; Belec, L.; Perrin, F.

When contaminated, sediments can act as a potential source of Hg and may pose a long-term risk to aquatic biota. The aim of this research was to assess spatial and historical distribution of Hg in the sediments of the Krka River estuary, an environment that so far has been regarded as relatively unpolluted. To achieve this goal, 40 surface sediment samples and 7 sediment cores were collected along the entire estuary. Hg concentrations in the surface and deep sediments of the Krka River estuary were found in a broad range 0.042-57.8 mg kg(-1), demonstrating significant spatial and temporal differences in Hg input to the estuarine sediments. Two distinct areas were distinguished; upper estuary where the Hg content was comparable to other unpolluted Adriatic sediments, and the lower estuary where sediment profiles reflected the history of anthropogenic Hg input associated with the city of Sibenik. The vertical Hg profile from the most affected area of the estuary, combined with Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating, demonstrated that a significant increase of Hg input started in late 1940s/early 1950s, mainly related to shipyard activities. This study provided more insight on the Hg concentration in the Krka River estuary, demonstrating that the high values obtained, although localized, were comparable to the ones found in some of the most contaminated sites in the Mediterranean.

Predicting marine litter accumulation patterns in the Mediterranean basin: Spatio-temporal variability and comparison with empirical data								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				182						102268	10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102268			MAR 2020	2020	The Mediterranean Sea is now acknowledged to be a hot spot for marine litter. However, little is known about Floating Macro Litter (FML) concentration at the scale of the entire basin; predictions regarding this would greatly help guide policymaking to fight this scourge. While previous studies have shown high spatio-temporal variability in FML distribution, the aim of this study was to accurately identify seasonal debris accumulation patterns on regional and local spatial scales across the Mediterranean basin. The objective was then to quantitatively compare this distribution model to other simulations and empirical data. We first studied FML distribution with a 2-D Lagrangian model coupled to an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) at a horizontal resolution of 1/12 degrees. From an initial homogeneous deployment, we deployed a set of >10(8) virtual particles across the whole basin and tracked each particle during 3-month journeys. Then we described the FML distribution model outputs and compared them both to empirical observations at the scale of the whole basin (gathered from a review of scientific papers on surface debris distribution), and to other numerical FML simulations from previous studies. The results of our offshore modeled distribution of FML fully agreed with characteristic debris accumulation patterns analyzed in our review of other studies. This indicates that our model could allow the prediction of monthly litter accumulation patterns at the scale of the entire Mediterranean Sea.

Assessing functional diversity: the influence of the number of the functional traits								THEORETICAL ECOLOGY				13	1			117	126		10.1007/s12080-019-00433-x			MAR 2020	2020	The impact of the variation of the number of functional traits on functional diversity assessment is still poorly known. Although the covariation between these two parameters may be desirable in some situations (e.g. if adding functional traits provides relevant new functional information), it may also result from mathematical artefacts and lead to misinterpretation of the results obtained. Here, we have tested the behaviour of a set of nine indices widely used for assessing the three main components of functional diversity (i.e. functional richness, evenness and divergence), according to the variation in the number of functional traits. We found that the number of functional traits may strongly impact the values of most of the indices considered, whatever the functional information they contain. The FRic, TOP and n-hypervolume indices that have been developed to characterize the functional richness component appeared to be highly sensitive to the variation in the number of traits considered. Regarding functional divergence, most of the indices considered (i.e. Q, FDis and FSpe) also showed a high degree of sensitivity to the number of traits considered. In contrast, we found that indices used to compute functional evenness (FEve and Ru), as well as one of the indices related to functional divergence (FDiv), are weakly influenced by the variation in the number of traits. All these results suggest that interpretation of most of the functional diversity indices considered cannot only be based on their values as they are, but requires taking into account the way in which they have been computed.

The athlete retired from running at 32 yr old (best marathon performance: 2:13:59) for a 16-yr period after his participation at the Olympics. Methods Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO2), ventilation (VE), blood lactate concentration (La), step frequency, and RE were measured during a treadmill-running test. Results His HRmax, VEmax, La-max, and VO2max were 165 bpm, 115 L center dot min(-1), 5.7 mmol center dot L-1, and 65.4 mL center dot kg(-1)center dot min(-1), respectively. At his marathon pace, his RE was 210 mL center dot kg(-1)center dot min(-1) with a step frequency of 199 +/- 0.55 s center dot min(-1), and his VO2 corresponded to 91% of his VO2max. Conclusion This study shows that despite a 16-yr break in training, this 59-yr-old former Olympian marathoner has managed to limit the age-related decline in performance to similar to 5% per decade. More generally, these data suggest that high-level endurance masters athletes can limit the age-related decline in endurance performance at least until the age of 60 yr and can preserve their ability to sustain high-intensity effort (>90% of VO2max) for long-duration (2-3 h) exercises.

The method is essentially the weighing of the transition energy of a layered superconductor where the contribution of vacuum energy to the transition energy is expected to be relevant. The transition is obtained by modulating the temperature of the superconducting sample at a frequency of about 10 mHz and the expected change of weight is measured with a suitably designed high sensitivity cryogenic beam balance. In this paper, we present an overview of the experiment, discussing the expected signal to be measured, and presenting in particular the result of a prototype balance operated in our present laboratory. In the frequency range of the measurement, the sensitivity is affected mainly by seismic, thermal, sensor, and control noise. We discuss these points showing in particular the design of the cryogenic apparatus, the final balance, and the quiet seismic site that will host the final measurement.

FVW and CWP at C/N ratios of 34, 39, 60, 71 and 82 were tested as substrates for DF. Dilution (1:2, 1:5, 1:10) of the DF effluents was used as a coupling strategy. DF effluents with low-butyrate and high lactate concentrations were obtained as a function of an increased C/N ratio, which results in high H-2 production during the PF. Maximum overall H-2 yields of 793.7 and 695.4 mLH(2)/gChemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were obtained using a 1:10 dilution, at a C/N ratio of 60 and 70, respectively. These H-2 yields were higher than those obtained with the individual processes. The C/N ratio at the DF stage regulate not only H-2 production but also the distribution and concentrations of by-products. These metabolites, in turn, control the H-2 production during the PF. Predominant microbial population for both processes (DF: C/N = 34 Acetobacter lovaniensis, Clostridium butyricum; C/N = 39 C butyricum, Enterobacter sp, Bifidobacterium; C/N = 82 Lactobacillus casei; PF: Rhodopseudomonas palustris) were in accordance with the final metabolic products.

High methylmercury levels have been found in the oxic subsurface waters of all oceans, but only anaerobic microorganisms have been shown to efficiently produce methylmercury in anoxic environments. The microaerophilic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria Nitrospina have previously been suggested as possible mercury methylating bacteria in Antarctic sea ice. However, the microorganisms responsible for processing inorganic mercury into methylmercury in oxic seawater remain unknown. Here, we show metagenomic and metatranscriptomic evidence that the genetic potential for microbial methylmercury production is widespread in oxic seawater. We find high abundance and expression of the key mercury methylating genes hgcAB across all ocean basins, corresponding to the taxonomic relatives of known mercury methylating bacteria from Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi. Our results identify Nitrospina as the predominant and widespread microorganism carrying and actively expressing hgcAB. The highest hgcAB abundance and expression occurs in the oxic subsurface waters of the global ocean where the highest MeHg concentrations are typically observed.

To date, in Chile, a large proportion of the SOC data have been collected in areas of intensive agricultural or forestry use; however, vast areas beyond these forms of land use have few or no soil data available. Here we present a new SOC database for the country, which is the result of an unprecedented national effort under the framework of the Global Soil Partnership. This partnership has helped build the largest database of SOC to date in Chile, named the Chilean Soil Organic Carbon database (CHLSOC), comprising 13 612 data points compiled from numerous sources, including unpublished and difficult-to-access data. The database will allow users to fill spatial gaps where no SOC estimates were publicly available previously. Presented values of SOC range from 6 x 10(-5) % to 83.3 %, reflecting the variety of ecosystems that exist in Chile. The database has the potential to inform and test current models that predict SOC stocks and dynamics at larger spatial scales, thus enabling benefits from the richness of geochemical, topographic and climatic variability in Chile.

In contrast to that prevailing idea, it has been gradually established that the epilimnetic CH4 does not originate exclusively from sediments but is also locally produced or laterally transported from the littoral zone. Therefore, CH4 cycling in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion might not be as closely linked as previously thought. We utilized a high-resolution method used to determine dissolved CH4 concentration to analyze a Siberian lake in which epilimnetic and hypolimnetic CH4 cycles were fully segregated by a section of the water column where CH4 was not detected. This layer, with no detected CH4, was well below the oxycline and the photic zone and thus assumed to be anaerobic. However, on the basis of a diffusion-reaction model, molecular biology, and stable isotope analyses, we determined that this layer takes up all the CH4 produced in the sediments and the deepest section of the hypolimnion. We concluded that there was no CH4 exchange between the hypolimnion (dominated by methanotrophy and methanogenesis) and the epilimnion (dominated by methane lateral transport and/or oxic production), resulting in a vertically segregated lake internal CH4 cycle.

The deposition rate and the chemical stability of the films are significantly different depending on the Ti precursor and process temperature (T-ALD). When the films are annealed a significant thickness shrinkage is reported for the first time on TiO2. A comprehensive analysis of the films with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared, ellipsometry, and porosimetry demonstrates that some precursor ligands are incorporated (most likely as isopropanol) when ALD is performed at low temperature (i.e., T-ALD < 200 degrees C) using TTIP. The trapped ligand molecules can be removed by annealing but make the film porous and thus have a detrimental effect on the dielectric properties. Higher-quality nonporous films are grown by using TTIP at T-ALD >= 200 degrees C or by using TDMAT. It is shown that measuring the refractive index is a simple, nondestructive, and reliable way to determine film quality. Numerical simulations of ligand coverage show that the measured growth rates are consistent with a self-limiting ALD mechanism albeit with partial incorporation of ligands from TTIP at low temperature (T-ALD < 200 degrees C), which renders part of the surface inactive toward growth. Aside from this, the higher growth rate of TDMAT is due to more desorption of ligands during the Ti precursor pulse. The overall decrease in the growth rate with temperature is related quantitatively to decreasing coverage of hydroxyl groups on TiO2. Comparing the TTIP and TDMAT processes in this way reveals new aspects of the gas-surface chemistry during self-limiting ALD and how this affects film morphology and electrical properties.

Gluon propagator and three-gluon vertex with dynamical quarks								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C				80	2					154	10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-7741-0			FEB 20 2020	2020	We present a detailed analysis of the kinetic and mass terms associated with the Landau gauge gluon propagator in the presence of dynamical quarks, and a comprehensive dynamical study of certain special kinematic limits of the three-gluon vertex. Our approach capitalizes on results from recent lattice simulations with (2+1) domain wall fermions, a novel nonlinear treatment of the gluon mass equation, and the nonperturbative reconstruction of the longitudinal three-gluon vertex from its fundamental Slavnov-Taylor identities. Particular emphasis is placed on the persistence of the suppression displayed by certain combinations of the vertex form factors at intermediate and low momenta, already known from numerous pure Yang-Mills studies. One of our central findings is that the inclusion of dynamical quarks moderates the intensity of this phenomenon only mildly, leaving the asymptotic low-momentum behavior unaltered, but displaces the characteristic "zero crossing" deeper into the infrared region. In addition, the effect of the three-gluon vertex is explored at the level of the effective gauge coupling, whose size is considerably reduced with respect to its counterpart obtained from the ghost-gluon vertex. The main upshot of the above considerations is the further confirmation of the tightly interwoven dynamics between the two- and three-point sectors of QCD.		[Aguilar, A. C.; Ferreira, M.

In this study correlations were established between microbial population and the process performance in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) treating increasing concentrations of phenol (from 120 to 1200 mg L-1). Sludge samples were taken at different operational stages and microbial community dynamics was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. In addition, bamA gene was quantified in order to evaluate the dynamics of anaerobic aromatic degraders. The microbial community was dominated by Anaerolineae, Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Methanobacteria classes. Correlation analysis between bamA gene copy number and phenol concentration were highly significant, suggesting that the increase of aromatic degraders targeted by bamA assay was due to an increase in the amount of phenol degraded over time. The incremental phenol concentration affected hydrogenotrophic archaea triggering a linear decrease of Methanobacterium and the growth of Methanobrevibacter. The best performance in the reactor was at 800 mg L-1 of phenol. At this stage, the highest relative abundances of Syntrophorhabdus, Chloroflexus, Smithella, Methanolinea and Methanosaeta were observed and correlated positively with initial degradation rate, suggesting that these microorganisms are relevant players to maintain a good performance in the ASBR.

In this study, we hypothesized that during exercise the hyperemia, commonly observed during exercise in air, was counteracted by the downregulation of the adenosinergic pathway during hyperoxic exposure. Methods Ten healthy volunteers performed two randomized sessions including gas exposure (Medical air or Oxygen) at rest and during exercise performed at 40% of maximal intensity, according to the individual fitness of the volunteers. Investigations included the measurement of adenosine plasma level (APL) and the recording of hemodynamic data [i.e., cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistances (SVR) using pulsed Doppler and echocardiography]. Results Hyperoxia significantly decreased APL (from 0.58 +/- 0.06 to 0.21 +/- 0.05 mu mol L-1, p < 0.001) heart rate and CO and increased SVR in healthy volunteers at rest. During exercise, an increase in APL was recorded in the two sessions when compared with measurements at rest (+0.4 +/- 0.4 vs. +0.3 +/- 0.2 mu mol L-1 for medical air and oxygen exposures, respectively). APL was lower during the exercise performed under hyperoxia when compared with medical air exposure (0.5 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.03 +/- 0.2 mu mol L-1, respectively p < 0.001). This result could contribute to the hemodynamic differences between the two conditions, such as the increase in SVR and the decrease in both heart rate and CO when exercises were performed during oxygen exposure as compared to medical air. Conclusion Hyperoxia decreased APLs in healthy volunteers at rest but did not eliminate the increase in APL and the decrease in SVR during low intensity exercise.

(Stop to Plastics in H2O!) focused on the study of microplastics (MPs) in the marine port environment to evaluate their presence, abundance, and mechanisms of diffusion to the open sea. In the framework of this project, a worldwide review of 74 studies was carried out, providing an overview of MP investigation techniques, focusing on sampling strategies, laboratory methodologies, and identification of MPs collected in seawater, and specifically evaluating their applicability to the marine port environment. Nets were the most commonly used device for MP surface sampling, but their use can be difficult in narrow spaces within the port basins, and they must be coupled to discrete sampling devices to cover all port basins. In the laboratory, density separation (NaCl, ZnCl2, NaI, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)), filtration (polycarbonate, polyamide, glass, cellulose, ANOPORE inorganic membrane filters), sieving, visual sorting, and digestion methods (acidic, enzymatic, alkaline, oxidative) were used to separate MPs from seawater. Digestion becomes essential with water samples with great inorganic and organic loads as deriving from a port. Although many studies are based only on visual MP identification under a microscope, analytical identification techniques unequivocally determine the particle nature and the identity of the plastic polymers and are necessary to validate the visual sorting of MPs. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is the most used analytical identification technique.

To assess their fate and impact on the environment, it is essential to investigate coastal circulation regimes which may play an important role in the dispersion of contaminants across the bay and beyond. In this study, a high resolution coupled hydrodynamic - passive tracer model was combined with ADCP observations, to identify major circulation patterns and associated dissolved contaminant dispersion pathways in the contaminated semi-enclosed bay of Toulon (South of France, NW Mediterranean Sea). Two dominant circulation patterns and two derived ones could be identified, driven by winds (Mistral and easterly winds) and offshore water intrusions. Medium to strong Mistral events (> 6 m s(-1)) with a WNW direction cause a bi-layer pattern with surface waters flowing out of the bay and marine waters entering at depth. Less frequently, west Mistral winds of medium to strong strength (> 6 m s(-1)) may generate an anticyclonic circulation. During easterly wind conditions (> 6 m s(-1)), an inward flow can be observed which is sometimes reinforced by offshore water intrusions, probably from the local boundary current, the Northern Current (NC). Furthermore, dissolved contaminant dispersion pathways were simulated under typical wind forcing conditions with three point sources of copper (Cu) that were identified based on surface Cu observations. While most of the WNW Mistral wind events transport dissolved copper plumes across and out of the bay, contaminant dispersion can remain confined to the bay under certain west mistral conditions. Conversely, during easterly wind events, contaminants are exiting the bay as a narrow vein along the Saint-Mandrier peninsula, before probably converging on the NC offshore. Accordingly, this study demonstrates the important impact of hydrodynamic-driven processes on the dispersion of contaminants within a semi-enclosed bay.

We derive the big-bang singularity resolution and big bounce from the first principle of full canonical LQG. Our results are obtained in the framework of the reduced phase space quantization of LQG. As a key step in our work, we derive with coherent states a new discrete path integral formula of the transition amplitude generated by the physical Hamiltonian. The semiclassical approximation of the path integral formula gives an interesting set of effective equations of motion (EOMs) for full LQG. When solving the EOMs with homogeneous and isotropic ansatz, we reproduce the LQC effective dynamics in the mu(0)-scheme. The solution replaces the big-bang singularity by a big bounce. In the end, we comment on the possible relation between the (mu) over bar -scheme of effective dynamics and the continuum limit of the path integral formula.

Objectives To investigate the acute effects of intense exercise on sleep and subsequent dietary intake. Methods Sixteen adolescent girls with obesity (age 13.7 +/- 1.1 years, weight 82.7 +/- 10.2 kg, body mass index (BMI) 30.5 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2), fat mass (FM) 39.2 +/- 3.1%, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 8.6 +/- 2.8, paediatric daytime sleepiness scale (PDSS) 19.6 +/- 5.9) took part in two experimental sessions in a random order: Control (CTL) and Exercise (EX). The two sessions were identical except for a continuous ergocycle exercise bout lasting 40 minutes and performed at 70% VO2max at the end of the morning of EX. Energy expenditure and sleep were measured by accelerometry and next-morning dietary intake in an ad libitum meal. Results Higher sleep duration (P < 0.03) and quality (decreased WASO: P < 0.02; increased SE%: P < 0.02) were observed in EX compared with CTL. This was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in caloric intake (-78 kcal) and a significant decrease in food energy density (P < 0.04), fat, and sugar consumption (respectively, P < 0.02 and P < 0.05) the following morning. Conclusions Acute exercise efficaciously increased sleep duration and quality, resulting in a decrease in subsequent energy-dense food consumption in adolescent girls with obesity.

(V)over dotO(2max), HRmax, (V)over dotE(max), and La-max were 65.4 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), 165 beats/min, 115 L/min, 5.7 mmol/L for the father and 66.9 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), 181 beats/min, 153 L/min, 11.5 mmol/L for the son, respectively. At 17 km/h, RE was 210 mL.kg(-1).km(-1) for the father and 200 mL.kg(-1).km(-1) for the son, and % (V)over dotO(2max) sustained was 90.9% for the father and 84.5% for the son, respectively. The father maintained an even running velocity during the marathon (running velocity CV <1%), while the son ran the second half-marathon 7% slower than the first one, and his running velocity markedly dropped from the 35th kilometer. Father and son who broke the World record time for combined father and son marathon had a similar level of performance, but their physiological profiles and pacing strategies during the marathon were different. A more even speed for the son could help them to improve their own record in the near future.

Natural zeolite-nanogels composite, with varying zeolite contents, were obtained by an inverse mini-emulsion technique and loaded with 5-fluorouracil, a widely used chemotherapeutic drug. Herein, the possibility of adjusting final properties by means of modifying the preparation conditions was investigated. The prepared composite nanogels are characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In light of this tunable drug-loading capability, swelling behaviour, and cytotoxicity, these composite nanogels could be highly attractive as drug reservoirs.

This research presents the development of a sensitive and biocompatible molecular imprinted sensor for the electrochemical detection of catechol, based on natural biopolymer-electroactive nanocomposites. Gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-decorated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been encapsulated in a polymeric chitosan (CS) matrix. This chitosan nanocomposite has been used to develop a molecular imprinted polymers (MIP) in the presence of catechol on a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode. The structure of the decorated MWCNT has been studied by TEM, whereas the characterization of the sensor surface has been imaged by AFM, demonstrating the satisfactory adsorption of the film and the adequate coverage of the decorated carbon nanotubes on the electrode surface. The electrochemical response of the sensor has been analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) where excellent reproducibility and repeatability to catechol detection in the range of 0 to 1 mM has been found, with a detection limit of 3.7 x 10(-5) M. Finally, the developed sensor was used to detect catechol in a real wine sample.

The difference in the precursor ratio leads to two morphologies, spindle and sphere, which remain unchanged with heat treatment up to 500 degrees C. However, the crystallite sizes of the as-obtained samples and samples treated at 300 and 500 degrees C are about 50-74 nm for spindles and 44-110 nm for spheres. Both morphologies and thermal treatments lead to the variation in the photoluminescence and photodegradation of rhodamine (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) dyes under UV irradiation. A stronger photodegradation efficiency was found for RhB (90%) than for MB (72%). The photoinduced mechanism is more significant for RhB and becomes more efficient for samples treated at high temperature, while the photocatalysis of MB is weak due to the adsorption process. A broad visible photoluminescence band was observed at room temperature and chromaticity coordinates were identified, which confirmed the emission wavelength. The most intense photoluminescence was obtained for samples treated at 300 degrees C, corresponding to the optimal disordered structures and accompanied by a redshift wavelength for both spheres and spindles. In this case, the spindles showed the most intense photoluminescence, almost ten times higher than that in spheres.

This type of SDEs was studied in statistical physics and represents the natural setting for stochastic mean-field games. We will first discuss questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions under an Osgood type condition improving the well-known Lipschitz case. Then, we derive various stability properties with respect to initial data, coefficients and driving processes, generalizing known results for classical SDEs. Finally, we establish a result on the approximation of the solution of a MVSDE associated to a relaxed control by the solutions of the same equation associated to strict controls. As a consequence, we show that the relaxed and strict control problems have the same value function. This last property improves known results proved for a special class of MVSDEs, where the dependence on the distribution was made via a linear functional.

The objective of this work was to investigate substrate oxidation during submaximal exercise in survivors of childhood acute leukemia. Methods: A total of 20 leukemia survivors and 20 healthy children were matched by sex, age, and Tanner stage. They all took a submaximal incremental exercise test to determine fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates. Results: Cardiorespiratory fitness was significantly lower in leukemia survivors, with lower relative VO2 peaks (p < 0.001), lower heart rate values (p = 0.02), and lower exercise power (p = 0.012), whereas rest metabolism and body mass index did not differ between the two groups. During exercise, upward of heart rate relative to VO2 peak was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in childhood leukemia survivors. We found lower carbohydrate and fat oxidation rates (p = 0.07) in leukemia survivors compared with healthy children, and also a significantly lower relative maximal fat oxidation rate (p = 0.014). Conclusion: Despite impaired physical fitness and metabolic response to exercise, childhood leukemia survivors remained sensitive to physical activity interventions, and could readily adapt to submaximal exercise intensity.

The results show that Almanarre beach suffered erosion with an average annual change rate of about -0.24 m/year over the period of 1973-2015. The most severe erosion was observed near Landmark B17 with the maximum erosion rate of -0.86 m/year. Moreover, the shoreline change in 2020 and 2050 are predicted at approximately -0.05 m/year and -0.22 m/year, respectively. The areas around Landmarks B06-08 and Landmarks B16-18 will be eroded with the maximum recession rates of -0.89 m/year and -0.94 m/year, respectively. This research proves that the combination of geospatial techniques and numerical model can be a reliable approach for investigating the shoreline change trend.

This study assessed the test-retest reliability of two RME-test methodologies. Fifteen healthy adults attended the laboratory on four occasions, separated by 5 +/- 2 days, and completed each test in a random, "one on two" order. They performed spirometry testing, maximal respiratory pressure assessment and two different RME tests: an inspiratory resistive breathing (IRB) and an isocapnic hyperpnea endurance (IHE) test. Typical error, expressed as coefficient of variation, for IRB maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and IHE maximal ventilation were 12.21 (8.85-19.67) % and 10.73 (7.78-17.29) %, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients for the same parameters were 0.83 (0.46-0.94) and 0.80 (0.41-0.93), respectively. No correlations were found between RME parameters derived from the IHE and IRB tests (all p > 0.05). Significant positive correlations were found between both IRB and IHE outcomes and spirometry parameters, MIP and maximal expiratory pressure (p < 0.05). Given these results, IRB and IHE appear to be suitable for RME testing in healthy people, although they may reflect different physiological mechanisms (respiratory mechanics and respiratory muscle capacity for IHE test vs. inspiratory muscle capacity for IRB test). Future studies are therefore warranted that compare IRB and IHE tests in clinical settings.

Econophysics literature enables us to build complementary, data-driven measures of financial integration using graphs. The present contribution investigates the potential and interests of a novel 3-step approach that combines several state-of-the-art procedures to (i) compute graph-based representations of the multivariate dependence structure of asset prices time series representing the financial states of 32 countries world-wide (1955-2015); (ii) compute time series of 5 graph-based indices that characterize the time evolution of the topologies of the graph; (iii) segment these time evolutions in piece-wise constant eras, using an optimization framework constructed on a multivariate multi-norm total variation penalized functional. The method shows first that it is possible to find endogenous stable eras of world-wide financial integration. Then, our results suggest that the most relevant globalization eras would be based on the historical patterns of global capital flows, while the major regulatory events of the 1970s would only appear as a cause of sub-segmentation.

The aim of this article is to point out some of the key features of this phenomenon from both the physical and the mathematical modeling point of view. Three-dimensional laminar flow over a smooth, axisymmetric hill is considered for a range of values of the Froude number and the Reynolds number. The numerical simulations are performed on the basis of the Boussinesq approximation model, solved with a high-resolution compact finite-difference numerical scheme. The numerical results obtained are discussed with respect to the observed physical phenomena, taking into account the separate role of varying the velocity (Reynolds number) and stratification (Froude number). The mathematical modeling and numerical solvability issues encountered are discussed in detail, pointing out the key role of the computational setup and boundary conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This "island mass effect" (IME) is typically identified by increased chlorophyll concentrations next to an island. Here we use a simple plankton model in a Lagrangian framework to represent an unexplained open ocean bloom, demonstrating how islands could have triggered it remotely. This new type of IME, termed "delayed IME," occurs when nitrate is limiting, N:P ratios are low, and excess phosphate and iron remain in water masses after an initial bloom associated with a "classical" IME. Nitrogen fixers then slowly utilize leftover phosphate and iron while water masses get advected away, resulting in a bloom decoupled in time (several weeks) and space (hundreds of kilometers) from island-driven nutrient supply. This study suggests that the fertilizing effect of islands on phytoplankton may have been largely underestimated.

Two field campaigns were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at an ice camp located on land-fast sea ice southeast of Qikiqtarjuaq Island in Baffin Bay (67.4797 degrees N, 63.7895 degrees W). During both expeditions, a large suite of physical, chemical and biological variables was measured beneath a consolidated sea-ice cover from the surface to the bottom (at 360m depth) to better understand the factors driving the PSB. Key variables, such as conservative temperature, absolute salinity, radiance, irradiance, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a concentration, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and taxonomy, and carbon stocks and fluxes were routinely measured at the ice camp. Meteorological and snow-relevant variables were also monitored. Here, we present the results of a joint effort to tidy and standardize the collected datasets, which will facilitate their reuse in other Arctic studies.

As an additional feature, some MCOs display an enhanced activity in solution in the presence of Cu2+. This is the case of the hyperthermophilic laccase HB27 from Thermus thermophilus, the physiologic role of which is unknown. As a particular feature, this enzyme presents a methionine rich domain proposed to be involved in copper interaction. In this work, laccase from T. thermophilus was produced in E. coli, and the effect of Cu2+ on its electroactivity at carbon nanotube modified electrodes was investigated. Direct O-2 electroreduction is strongly dictated by carbon nanotube surface chemistry in accordance with the enzyme dipole moment. In the presence of Cu2+, an additional low potential cathodic wave occurs, which was never described earlier. Analysis of this wave as a function of Cu2+ availability allows us to attribute this wave to a cuprous oxidase activity displayed by the laccase and induced by copper binding close to the Cu T1 center. A mutant lacking the methionine-rich hairpin domain characteristic of this laccase conserves its copper activity suggesting a different site of copper binding. This study provides new insight into the copper effect in methionine rich MCOs and highlights the utility of the electrochemical method to investigate cuprous oxidase activity and to understand the physiological role of these MCOs.

However, they are poorly studied worldwide. To improve knowledge on the socio-ecological significance and conservation of Tetraodontiformes a review of literature addressing the diversity, ecology, use and trade, conservation, and main threats of Tetraodontiformes combined with a comprehensive in situ dataset from two broad-range multidisciplinary oceanographic surveys performed along the Tropical Brazilian Continental Shelf was undertaken. Twenty-nine species were identified, being primarily found on coral reefs and algal ecosystems. At these habitats, tetraodontids present highly diversified trophic categories and might play an important role by balancing the marine food web Coral reef ecosystems, especially those near to the shelf break, seem to be the most important areas of Tetraodontiformes fishes, concentrating the highest values of species richness, relative abundance and the uncommon and Near Threatened species. Ninety per cent of species are commonly caught as bycatch, being also used in the ornamental trade (69%) and as food (52%), serving as an important source of income for artisanal local fisheries. Tetraodontiformes are threatened by unregulated fisheries, overexploitation, bycatch, and habitat loss due to coral reef degradation and the potential effects of climate change. These factors are more broadly impacting global biodiversity, food security, and other related ecosystem functions upon which humans and many other organisms rely. We recommend the following steps that could improve the conservation of Tetraodontiformes along the tropical Brazilian Continental shelf and elsewhere: (i) data collection of the commercial, incidental, ornamental and recreational catches; (ii) improvement of the current legislation directed at the marine ornamental harvesting; (iii) increase efforts focused on the education and conservation awareness in coastal tourism and communities; and, most important, (iv) creation of marine reserves networks in priority areas of conservation, protecting either the species and key habitats for its survival.

This paper aims to study the impact of the microbial inoculum source on pre-treatment behavior, with a special focus on microbial community changes. Two inocula (aerobic and anaerobic sludge) and two pre-treatments (aeration and heat shock) were investigated using glycerol as substrate during a continuous operation. Our results show that the inoculum source significantly affected the pre-treatment efficiency. In aerobic sludge no pre-treatment is necessary, while in anaerobic sludge the heat pre-treatment increased H-2 production but aeration caused unstable H-2 production. In addition, biokinetic control was key in Clostridium selection as dominant species in all microbial communities. Lower and unstable H-2 production were associated with a higher relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae family members. Our results allow a better understanding of H-2 production in continuous systems and how the microbial-community is affected. This provides key information for efficient selection of operating conditions for future applications. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Synthesis, hydrolysis and surface wettability								POLYMER				186						121954	10.1016/j.polymer.2019.121954			JAN 9 2020	2020	Amphiphilic hydrolyzable block copolymers composed of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) first block and a random poly(ethyleneglycol methacrylate (PEGMA)-co-trialkylsilyl methacrylate (TRSiMA, R = butyl, isopropyl) second block were synthesized by RAFT polymerization and dispersed as surface-active amphiphilic additives in a condensation cure PDMS matrix. Poly(tributylsilyl methacrylate) (pTBSiMA) and poly(triisopropylsilyl methacrylate) (pTiPSiMA) homopolymers and random copolymers PEGMA-co-TRSiMA were also synthesized as model polymers for comparison. The hydrolysis rates of the polymers in both ammonia buffer and artificial seawater were shown to drastically depend on the nature of the trialkylsilyl groups, with TiPSiMA polymers undergoing a slower rate hydrolysis. The incorporation of PEGMA units in the copolymers was found to increase the hydrolysis rate. On the other hand, the presence of the PDMS block led to a decrease in the hydrolysis rate for the block copolymers. Wettability studies of the elastomer PDMS-based films containing a surface-active additive block copolymer were carried out in both static and dynamic conditions. All the films were found to be both hydrophobic and lipophobic and became more hydrophilic after 30 days of water immersion. Measurements of advancing and receding contact angles with water confirmed the ability of the film surfaces to respond to the water environment.

This circulation affects the physical and biogeochemical environment on both sides of the bay. The phytoplanktonic species composition is driven by its environment and, in turn, shapes carbon transfer through the planktonic food web. This study aims at determining the effects of such contrasting environments on ecosystem structure and functioning and the consequences for the carbon cycle. Ecological indices calculated from food web flow values provide ecosystem properties that are not accessible by direct in situ measurement. From new biological data gathered during the Green Edge project, we built a planktonic food web model for each side of Baffin Bay, considering several biological processes involved in the carbon cycle, notably in the gravitational, lipid, and microbial carbon pumps. Missing flow values were estimated by linear inverse modeling. Calculated ecological network analysis indices revealed significant differences in the functioning of each ecosystem. The eastern Baffin Bay food web presents a more specialized food web that constrains carbon through specific and efficient pathways, leading to segregation of the microbial loop from the classical grazing chain. In contrast, the western food web showed redundant and shorter pathways that caused a higher carbon export, especially via lipid and microbial pumps, and thus promoted carbon sequestration. Moreover, indirect effects resulting from bottom-up and top-down control impacted pairwise relations between species differently and led to the dominance of mutualism in the eastern food web. These differences in pairwise relations affect the dynamics and evolution of each food web and thus might lead to contrasting responses to ongoing climate change.

More precisely, we address the question of generating a 3D field with a given one-point function (e.g. log-normal) and some power spectrum fixed by cosmology. We highlight and investigate a problem that occurs in the log-normal case when the field is filtered, and we identify a regime where this approximation still holds. However, we show that the filtering is unnecessary if aliasing effects are taken into account and the discrete sampling step is carefully controlled. In this way we demonstrate a sub-percent precision of all our spectra up to the Nyquist frequency. We extend the method to generate a full light cone evolution, comparing two methods for this process, and validate our method with a tomographic analysis. We analytically and numerically investigate the structure of the covariance matrices obtained with such simulations which may be useful for future large and deep surveys.

The considered problem is to reach a given steady state from an initial one by controlling the firing flow of transitions. The proposed strategy is event-driven and the control actions are updated only when specific events occur. It is based on an algorithm with a linear programming problem that computes a new control firing flow vector when the considered events occur. The convergence of the marking to its steady state marking by the proposed strategy is proved and an example is provided to illustrate the computation steps. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Recent developments in machine learning have the potential of rendering this information accessible to a larger audience. Data-driven approaches to automatic manuscript recognition require large amounts of transcribed scans to work. To this end, we introduce a new handwritten corpus based on 400-year-old, cursive, early modern Dutch documents such as ship journals and daily logbooks. This is a 1000 page collection, segmented into lines, to facilitate fully-, weakly- and un-supervised research and with textual transcriptions on 20% of the pages. Other annotations such as handwriting slant, year of origin, complexity, and writer identity have been manually added. With over 80 writers this corpus is significantly larger and more varied than other existing historical data sets such as Spanish RODRIGO.

BABEL-LITTERATURES PLURIELLES				42						11388	10.4000/babel.11388			2020	2020	Since the Joy of the Court of Erec and Enide, the motif of knight's heads cut off and displayed on stakes appears regularly in theversified novels in the thirteenth century. Men's heads, always cut by another knight, most often at the request of a lady or young lady to punish an offence, sexual fault or bankruptcy, or to prove to a lover her virile and martial value. But to this detour of the courteous love/prouess dyad are added beheadings without apparent motive, collections of heads initiated by men, or damsels who decapitate their prey themselves. What is the meaning of this motif in the Arthurian verse literature ? Is it still reminiscent of courtesy codes, or is it necessary to look for another definition ?

In three 15th c. illuminated manuscripts and in the 15th English romance Richard Coer de Lyon, beheadings in the Holy Land are illustrated by Saladin's beheading of Renaud de Chatillon, who is seen as both hero and martyr. But with Richard's barbaric cannibalism, the arch-diabolical image of the Saracen is reversed, and serves the diffusion of an anti-Frankish, English nationalistic propaganda targeted against the French.

In bioacoustics, almost all studies are still done with human labeling. In passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), the data to label are made up from months of continuous recordings with multiple recording stations and the time required to label everything with human labeling is longer than the next recording session will take to produce new data, even with multiple experts. To help lay a foundation for the emergence of automatic labeling of marine mammal transients, we built a dataset using weak labels from a 3TB dataset of marine mammal transients of DCLDE 2018. The DCLDE dataset was made for a click classification challenge. The new dataset has strong labels and opened a new challenge, DOCC10, whose baseline is also described in this paper. The accuracy of 71% of the baseline is already good enough to curate the large dataset, leaving only some regions of interest still to be expertised. But this is far from perfect, and there remains space for future improvement, or challenging alternative techniques. A smaller version of DOCC10 named DOCC7 is also presented.

A.; Khurana, Sameer; Alumae, Tanel; Laurent, Antoine			IEEE					Robust Training of Vector Quantized Bottleneck Models								IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)														2020	2020	In this paper we demonstrate methods for reliable and efficient training of discrete representation using Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder models (VQ-VAEs). Discrete latent variable models have been shown to learn nontrivial representations of speech, applicable to unsupervised voice conversion and reaching state-of-the-art performance on unit discovery tasks. For unsupervised representation learning, they became viable alternatives to continuous latent variable models such as the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). However, training deep discrete variable models is challenging, due to the inherent non differentiability of the discretization operation. In this paper we focus on VQ-VAE, a state-of-the-art discrete bottleneck model shown to perform on par with its continuous counterparts. It quantizes encoder outputs with on-line k-means clustering. We show that the codebook learning can suffer from poor initialization and non-stationarity of clustered encoder outputs. We demonstrate that these can be successfully overcome by increasing the learning rate for the codebook and periodic date dependent codeword re-initialization. As a result, we achieve more robust training across different tasks, and significantly increase the usage of latent codewords even for large code books. This has practical benefit, for instance, in unsupervised representation learning, where large codebooks may lead to disentanglement of latent representations.

Collecting such amounts of data can lead to labelling errors in the training set. Indexing multimedia content for retrieval, classification or recommendation can involve tagging or classification based on multiple criteria. In our case, we train face recognition systems for actors identification with a closed set of identities while being exposed to a significant number of perturbators (actors unknown to our database).

Manual assembly tasks include different activities to obtain functional products. In order to estimate the assembly cost and elaborate the assembly plan for a product, it is important to measure the duration of the assembly operations. The research reported in this paper aims at investigating if Fitts' law, which has been widely adopted in numerous research areas including kinematics, human factors and human-computer interaction, can be adopted as a model to estimate the movement time in assembling parts in virtual assembly environment with haptic feedback. The results reported in this paper showed that Fitts' law can be applied for modelling the movement time in assembling cylindrical parts. However, the analysis of the experimental data showed that when changing the diameter of the moved part, this could have an effect on the movement time. This is promising for the formulation of an inverted Fitts' law for cylindrical parts' assembly.

These events have prompted intense efforts in fundamental and applied research on macroalgae in this ecoregion, especially regarding species of the order Fucales (Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum pacificum). Recently, however, these proliferations have occurred with a higher frequency, and they now involve additional species. Specifically, over the past decade, the abundance of species belonging to the Dictyotaceae family (e.g., Dictyota bartayresiana and Spatoglossum asperum) has increased on coral reefs around Tahiti Island, the largest and most inhabited island in FP. On the course of evolution, these species have developed physical and chemical defenses to deter grazers, including the production of a wide array of specialized metabolites. These molecules are of particular interest for their promising biological activities as well as for the new Blue Economy opportunities they can offer to FP. We review the current state of knowledge on the diversity, ecology, and potential uses of Dictyotaceae species present in FP. The first section focuses on the diversity and distribution of the family Dictyotaceae in FP. The second part examines the ecological dynamics of Dictyotaceae species in the coral reef ecosystem and their response to various environmental factors. The third and final part reviews the metabolites known from Dictyotaceae species that are present in FP, their associated biological activities, and potential for the development of biotechnological applications in FP.

In spite of the emergence of higher-order probabilistic programming languages, not much has been done to combine those two approaches. In this paper, we initiate a study on the probabilistic higher-order model checking problem, by giving some first theoretical and experimental results. As a first step towards our goal, we introduce PHORS, a probabilistic extension of higher-order recursion schemes (HORS), as a model of probabilistic higher-order programs. The model of PHORS may alternatively be viewed as a higher-order extension of recursive Markov chains. We then investigate the probabilistic termination problem or, equivalently, the probabilistic reachability problem. We prove that almost sure termination of order-2 PHORS is undecidable. We also provide a fixpoint characterization of the termination probability of PHORS, and develop a sound (although possibly incomplete) procedure for approximately computing the termination probability. We have implemented the procedure for order-2 PHORS, and confirmed that the procedure works well through preliminary experiments.

Surface horizons and deep Bh of Amazonian podzols were sampled and kept under refrigeration to maintain moisture of sampling time. Incubations of aliquot of the same sample were initiated on the sampling day and 3, 6, 9 and 12 days after sampling. Other aliquots were conducted on a tension table to given water potential (60 cm H2O) prior to incubation. Soil samples, whether disturbed or not, should not be dried but kept at sampling moisture in semi-open plastic bags under refrigeration at 4 degrees C, respiration monitoring must be conducted without prior water potential adjustment. In such conditions,12 days between sampling and beginning of measurement did not affected respiration results. The method used for agricultural soils gave different results and does not make sense for soils under perudic moisture regime. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Abedini, Javad; Peridy, Nicolas								The Relevance of Regional Integration in the Euromed Area: Evidence from a Logistic Median-Voter Model								REGION ET DEVELOPPEMENT					52									2020	2020	Regional integration in Europe and more generally into the Euro-Mediterranean (Euromed) area has recently been debated and increasingly questioned. The Median-Voter approach provides a methodical way to answering such questions through comparing the relative utility of the median voters before and after the integration. In this study, we suggest a conditional fixed-effect logit model, which relates such a relative utility to some observables, such as differences of countries in factor endowments and technology, to estimate the likelihood of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) creation across the entire Euromed area. Including all FTA partner countries in the world between 1981 and 2019, we estimate the likelihood of FTA creation for all country pairs as well as at country and regional level in the Euromed area. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metrics shows excellent performance of our model in truly predicting the (past) FTA and No-FTA events. Similarly, a Reverse Backtesting procedure is developed to attribute an FTA realization, from "impossible" to "highly probable", to each estimated probability. With an estimated probability equal to 82.6%, the European integration is qualified as a probable FTA, while the Non-European-Med integration (46.6%) and the overall Euromed integration (60.5%) are perceived as just "possible FTAs".

To incorporate this concept in practical systems, there were two main technological bottle necks that have to be overcome: antenna miniaturization and rectification in terahertz frequency. With current technology and equipment [2], we are proposing a third-generation rectenna-based solar cells composed of Ag nanocubes to harvest ambient visible and infrared electromagnetic waves coupled to ferrocene-based molecular diodes [3] capable of switching at terahertz frequency to convert this received energy into DC power. The function of these molecular diodes is two-fold: they rectify and provide an uniform nano-cavity between silver top electrode and gold bottom electrode. These nano-cavities are capable to support gap plasmon modes and absorption of light in both narrow and broad range, depending on the nanocube size and dispersion. A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of ferrocene alkane-dithiol is deposited in this nano-cavity making it possible to form molecular sized nano-gaps well below the usual 3 nm, and this structure is robust and reproducible [4]. This SAM can be deposited directly or via a two-step click chemistry on the surface to have along with control over the orientation of the molecule. By tuning the orientation and position of the ferrocene moiety, the direction of rectification can be controlled [3]. Hence, the SAM does not only act as a rectifier but also provides mechanical support combining photonic and electrical properties. This paper focuses on studying the electrical and supramolecular structure of these molecular diode based SAMs.		[Jangid, Vikas; Reynaud, Clement A.; Sanchez-Adaime, Esteban; Duche, David; Simon, Jean-Jacques; Escoubas, Ludovic] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IM2NP, F-13397 Marseille, France; [Jangid, Vikas; Lebouin, Chrystelle] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, MADIREL, UMR 7246, F-13397 Marseille, France; [Brunel, Damien; Dumur, Frederic] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, ICR, UMR 7273, F-13397 Marseille, France; [Berginc, Gerard] Thales Optron, F-78990 Elancourt, France; [Nijhuis, Christian A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem, Singapore 117546, Singapore; [Nijhuis, Christian A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Adv 2D Mat, 6 Sci Dr 2, Singapore 117546, Singapore; [Nijhuis, Christian A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Graphene Res Ctr, 6 Sci Dr 2, Singapore 117546, Singapore; [Escoubas, Ludovic] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IM2NP, F-13397 Marseille, France								0							Materials Science, Multidisciplinary	WOS:000599190900008

This reappropriation finds its roots in a mechanism of resilience, which induces an intimate participation of the author, which highlights the cathartic dimension of literary testimony. Between reality and fiction, fictional testimony and testimonial literature, the literary possibilities turn out to be multifaceted. How does Leila Marouane deal with the expectation of the reader in these years of Algerian civil war ? How to move from the "I" who lived to the "other" who reads and who receives ? Language will be thought in this article as the foundation of a cultural identity to be built or reconstructed, hence the reflection that we will be carrying out on the notions of interbreeding, subjectivity and reflexivity of language in Leila Marouane's work. The concept of pseudonymy and the notion of "foreigner", through the prism of exile literature, will also be discussed.

They denounced the confiscation of power and the corruption of the anti-colonial fight using only two weapons : poetry and the French language. At the same time, they have encouraged tighter relations between the two sides of the Mediterranean. Their very peculiar situation, being related to several cultures and several territories, explains why they can be regarded as forerunners of modern identities placed under the sign of cultural hybridation.

Indeed, as in Carole Martinez's, Jeanne Benameur's and Kaoutar Harchi's novels, they show this state of "identity crisis", this overwhelming change in the way we see ourselves. Literature also shows the work's key process of female identity building which is, as we will explain, the way towards women's emancipation.

The paper delivers a migration analysis based on data from the French Population Census with personal information on the individual as age, educational level, family type, access to property, etc. The article focuses on regional migration trends between 2012 and 2017 by distinguishing young people aged 15 to 29 from the population aged 30 and over, and on how the territorial characteristics (economic, social or environmental) affect migration flows. Using Probit and Heckman models, it appears that young people (active or students) prefer to locate in areas where the weight of the creative and cultural industries is important.

IEEE					Design of a Battery-powered Emitter dedicated to the Characterization of Human Body Communications								2020 15TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DESIGN & TECHNOLOGY OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS IN NANOSCALE ERA (DTIS 2020)														2020	2020	Human Body Communications (HBC), which has been standardized around 21MHz, potentially offers more favourable propagation conditions than usual wireless technologies such as ZigBee, or Bluetooth. However, due their sensitivity to the close environment, the signal attenuation cannot be accurately determined using lab equipment. For this reason, a battery-powered emitter with emitted power estimation capability is fully described in this paper. The prototype implemented in a 5x5 cm PCB is supplied with a 3.3V battery and has been built around a microcontroller (MCU). The MCU has been programmed to generate a 21MHz square carrier and to under-sample it at 480ksps using the MCU embedded Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). To enable the carrier power estimation with this constraint, the Goertzel light discrete Fourier transform algorithm has been implemented using particular parameters values. Finally, to overcome the bandwidth limitations of the ADC MCU pin, an external sample & hold circuit driven by the MCU have been added and optimized.		[Mefteh, R.

The considered passive cell comprised of resistor and capacitor elements without inductor operates as a bandpass (BP) NGD function. The specifications of NGD functions are defined. Generally, the BP NGD fully lumped circuits available in the literature operate with resonant RLC-network. In the introduced research work, a lumped circuit was first time identified to exhibit the BP behavior without the presence of inductive component. The inductorless BP NGD topology is inspired from the combination of low-pass (LP) and high-pass (HP) NGD passive cells. Therefore, an original LP-HP NGD composite topology is obtained. The identified BP NGD topology is constituted only by passive RC-networks. Then, theoretical development of BP NGD analysis is explored. The inductorless circuit theory starts with the identification of BP NGD canonical form. Then, the expressions of NGD value, center frequency and attenuation in function of RC-network parameters are established. The synthesis equations allowing to determine the resistor and capacitor elements are derived. Proofs-of-concept are designed and prototypes are fabricated to verify the effectiveness of the developed LP-HP NGD composite theory. To validate the developed original circuit theory, two prototypes of RC-network based LP-HP NGD composite were designed, fabricated, simulated and tested. The two prototypes were synthesized with respect to two different NGD center frequencies 13.5 MHz and 22 MHz. As expected, the calculated, simulated and measurement results are in very good agreement with NGD value of about some negative nanoseconds. In the future, the characterized inductorless topology enable to overcome the traditional limitations of RLC-network based BP NGD circuits because of inductance self-effect limitation.

The modelling principle is using the equivalent RC-network of wall, door and air constituting the house. For a better understanding, the temperature propagation was assumed only in a 1-D horizontal direction. The problem geometrization is defined in function of rectangular approximation meshing. After the determination of the equivalent thermal resistor and thermal capacitor, the innovative thermal circuit representing the room is elaborated. The methodology of the Kron's formalism, implicitly described with the different action steps is introduced. The thermal room Kron's method is implemented from the branch to mesh spaces before the expression of the problem metric. The thermal transfer functions (TTFs) at three cases of indoor points, situated near, middle and far of the door are established from the Kron's problem metric. The feasibility of the room thermal Kron's TTF model is validated with SPICE TTF simulations in both frequency and time domains. The thermal cut-off frequencies are verified with very good correlation between the established TTF model and simulation. An excellent prediction of transient responses with unit-step and arbitrary waveform temperature signals with a minimal and maximal amplitude of about 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C is proposed.

The technique is based on the use of bandpass negative group delay (NGD) function. The principle of the propagation delay reduction is introduced by considering a simple scenario of Tx multi-wireless sensors communicating with a single Rx sensor. With the consideration of bandpass NGD function, it is shown that the differential between the propagation delay can be reduced considerably. The feasibility of the technique is confirmed with group delay diagram by considering microstrip NGD prototype measured S-parameters.

The electrical interconnections with vias become key regular solutions for the implementation of various electronic functions. However, so far, the vias are never being used for designing negative group delay (NGD) circuit. To answer this curious question, an original study on the design feasibility of low-pass NGD function with via ground is introduced in the present paper. After the topological description, the NGD analysis in function of the via parameters is established. The design equations allowing to synthesize the via in function of NGD function specifications are formulated. The developed NGD theory is verified with comparisons between calculations and simulations with a commercial tool. As expected, NGD value in order of hundred-picoseconds over hundred-megahertz cut-off frequencies is obtained with good agreement between the theoretical model and simulation. Furthermore, time domain analyses confirm that the via NGD structure enables to generate output signals in time-advance of arbitrary waveform input signals presenting limited bandwidth.

Besides the low cost, the sensitive layer will be endowed with: good resistance over time due to the use of synthetic polymer, permanent monitoring and reuse. The preparation of MIP was carried out by wet phase inversion. In this way, thin membranes were obtained by water immersion of the support with the MIP precursors or control solutions, noted non-imprinted polymers (NIP). The ephedrine was used as template in the imprinting process. The obtained membranes were analyzed both before and after removal of the template molecule, using specific characterization techniques.

Write Termination (WT) circuits are a potential solution to solve these issues. However, previously reported WT circuits do not demonstrate sufficient reliability. In this work, we propose an industrially-ready WT circuit that was simulated with a RRAM model calibrated on real measurements. We perform extensive CMOS and RRAM variability simulations to extract the actual performances of the proposed WT circuit. Finally, we simulate the effects of the proposed WT circuit with memory traces extracted from real Edge-level data-intensive applications. Overall, we demonstrate 2 x to 40 x of energy gains at bit level. Moreover, we show from 1.9 x to 16.2 x energy gains with real applications running depending on the application memory access pattern thanks to the proposed WT circuit.

This circuit topology is originally implemented with a tri-coupled line (3CL) six-port element with the lateral side connected through lossy transmission lines (TLs). After description of the electrical equivalent diagram, the S-matrix model is established. The group delay (GD) is formulated from the transmission coefficient as a function of the 0IO topological parameters. The effectiveness of the GD modelling is verified with a microstrip circuit proof-of-concept (POC). Simulations and measurements, which are in good agreement, confirm the dual-band bandpass NGD behavior of the 0IO POC. The fabricated prototype generates NGD levels better than -1 ns at NGD center frequencies of about 2.2 GHz and 3 GHz. In addition, to this good NGD performance, the 0IO POC operates with a low insertion loss better than 2.5 dB and reflection losses better than 12 dB in the NGD bandwidths.

Using a tightly-controlled clinical trial protocol with the highest Jadad score of 5/5, the current trial aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of a 2-strain mixture of: Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) to improve IBS symptoms. Eighty patients diagnosed with IBS according to Rome III criteria were recruited to a multicentric, double-blind, in parallel groups, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Patients were provided with a daily dose of two capsules containing either two probiotic strains (5 x 10(9) cfu/capsule) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was abdominal pain score assessed with a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints included scores of bloating, flatus and rumbling assessed with a 100-mm VAS, a composite score that consisted of the sum of the 4 VAS scores, and the stool frequency and consistency assessed with the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Our study has failed to demonstrate a significant improvement of the primary endpoint of abdominal pain. Significant differences between groups were observed for flatus score at week 4 (P=0.04) and week 8 (P=0.03) and for composite score at week 8 (P=0.04). The consumption of the 2-strain mixture of L. acidophilus over 8 weeks is safe, significantly decreases flatus and composite scores. The significant effect on flatus could result from the species-specific homofer-mentative properties of L. acidophilus strains. The negative results on abdominal pain and the gained experience are discussed for the future clinical trials in IBS.

The introduced reconstruction technique is originally realized with unfamiliar low-pass negative group delay (NGD) function. The feasibility condition of the proposed reconstruction technique in function of the sensor signal spectrum bandwidth under consideration is elaborated. The reconstruction technique principle is theoretically introduced by means of identification of low-pass NGD function parameters and the appropriated circuit topology. The unfamiliar low-pass NGD function analysis and synthesis equations are established. As an example, for the feasibility study, an RC-network based low-pass active cell is considered to implement the low-pass NGD function. A design method of NGD circuit in function of the sensor distortion transfer function is described in different successive steps. The developed NGD reconstruction technique is validated by different proofs of concept. First, transient simulations are carried out with Gaussian and sinc analytical signals. Then, experimental feasibility study is also performed with arbitrary waveform signal. As expected, the NGD reconstruction technique efficiency is confirmed with improvement of distorted signal integrity parameters and cross correlation better than 97%.

In order to improve plant growth for restoration programs, special attention was paid to interactions between plant and soil microorganisms. In this study, we evaluated the influence of inoculation with Curtobacterium citreum BE isolated from a New Caledonian ultramafic soil on arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and growth of Tetraria comosa, an endemic sedge used in restoration programs. A greenhouse experiment on ultramafic substrate was conducted with an inoculum comprising two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species isolated from New Caledonian ultramafic soils: Rhizophagus neocaledonicus and Claroideoglomus etunicatum. The effects on plant growth of the AMF and C. citreum BE inoculated separately were not significant, but their co-inoculation significantly enhanced the dry weight of T. comosa compared with the non-inoculated control. These differences were positively correlated with mycorrhizal colonization which was improved by C. citreum BE. Compared with the control, co-inoculated plants were characterized by better mineral nutrition, a higher Ca/Mg ratio, and lower metal translocation. However, for Ca/Mg ratio and metal translocation, there were no significant differences between the effects of AMF inoculation and co-inoculation.

Strain PAR22N(T) grew at temperatures between 15 and 37 degrees C (optimum, 32 degrees C), at pH between pH 8.3 and 10.1 (optimum, pH 9.0-9.6), and in the presence of NaCl up to 10%. Pyruvate, 2-methylbutyrate and fatty acids (4-18 carbon atoms) were used as electron donors in the presence of sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor and were incompletely oxidized to acetate and CO2. Besides sulfate, both sulfite and elemental sulfur were also used as terminal electron acceptors and were reduced to sulfide. The predominant fatty acids were summed feature 10 (C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 9t and/or C-18:1 omega 12t), C-18:1 omega 9c and C-16:0. The genome size of strain PAR22NT was 3.8 Mb including 3391 predicted genes. The genomic DNA G+C content was 49.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that it belongs to the genus Desulfobotulus within the class Deltaproteobacteria. Its closest phylogenetic relatives are Desulfobotulus alkaliphilus (98.4% similarity) and Desulfobotulus sapovorans (97.9% similarity). Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, we propose that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Desulfobotulus with the name Desulfobotulus mexicanus sp. nov. The type strain is PAR22N(T) (=DSM 105758(T)=JCM 32146(T)).		[Perez-Bernal, Maria Fernanda; Brito, Elcia M.

The SWASH code is used to simulate wave propagation in nearshore waters and compute suitable boundary conditions at the beachface to force Richards equation.

The structural characterization of the LaCoO3 thin films was done by combining several techniques: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD). The thin films crystallized in the expected rhombohedral phase whatever the deposition temperature, with an increase of crystallite size from 70 nm at 750 degrees C to 100 nm at 1000 degrees C, and an average thickness of the thin films of less than 200 nm. At 850 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, the thin films are crack-free, and with a lower number of droplets than the film deposited at 750 degrees C. The grains of LaCoO3 film deposited at 850 degrees C are columnar, with a triangular termination. At 1000 degrees C, an intermediate layer of La2Si2O7 was observed, indicating diffusion of Si into the deposited film.

Both isolates were moderately halophilic, neutrophilic and had a temperature optimum at 37 degrees C. The highest 16S rRNA gene sequence identity values were found with members of the genus Sedimentisphaera (84.9-88.2%) within the order Sedimentisphaerales, class Phycisphaerae. The strain SM-Chi-D1(T) could be assigned to the family Sedimentisphaeraceae, while phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and genomic data indicate that strain ST-NAGAB-D1(T) is both a member of a novel genus and a novel family. SM-Chi-D1(T) could be distinguished from other cultured members of the Sedimentisphaeraceae mainly by the stimulatory effect of sulfur on growth, lack of ethanol production during fermentation and several differences in the cellular fatty acids and polar lipids patterns. Main differential characteristics of ST-NAGAB-D1(T) were a polytrichous flagellation, the absence of branched chain fatty acids and presence of large proportions of the unsaturated cellular fatty acids C-16:1 c9 and C-18:1 c11. On the basis of genomic, chemotaxonomic, biochemical and physiological data, we propose the novel species and genera Anaerohalosphaera lusitana gen. nov., sp. nov., and Limihaloglobus sulfuriphilus gen. nov., sp. nov., represented by the type strains ST-NAGAB-D1(T) (=DSM 103484(T)=JCM 31926(T)=KCTC 15600(T)) and SM Chi-D1(T) (=DSM 100118(T)=JCM 31927(T)=KCTC 15601(T)), respectively.

The analysis sheds light on conceptual questions such as the treatment of time or the role and scaling behavior of statistical and quantum fluctuations. In the case of fluctuations, several analytical and numerical results show agreement between the two approaches and offer possible explanations of effects that have been seen in causal dynamical triangulations but whose origin remained unclear. The new approach followed here suggests "CDT experiments" in the form of new simulations or evaluations motivated by theoretical predictions, testing CDTs as well as the minisuperspace approximation.

JEVD aims to find a common basis of eigenvectors to a set of matrices. JEVD problem is encountered in many signal processing applications. In particular, recent and efficient algorithms for the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of multiway arrays resort to a JEVD step. The suggested method is based on multiplicative updates. It is distinguishable by the use of a first-order Taylor Expansion to compute the inverse of the updating matrix. We call this approach Joint eigenvalue Decomposition based on Taylor Expansion (JDTE). This approach is derived in two versions based on simultaneous and sequential optimization schemes respectively. Here, simultaneous optimization means that all entries of the updating matrix are simultaneously optimized at each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, such an optimization scheme had never been proposed to solve the JEVD problem in a multiplicative update procedure. Our numerical simulations show that, in many situations involving complex matrices, the proposed approach improves the eigenvectors estimation while keeping a limited computational cost. Finally, these features are highlighted in a practical context of source separation through the CPD of telecommunication signals.

The triangulation is changed through Pachner moves, induced by the walker density itself, allowing the surface to transform into any topologically equivalent one. This model extends the quantum walk over triangular grid, introduced in a previous work, by one of the authors, whose space-time limit recovers the Dirac equation in (2+1)-dimensions. Numerical simulations show that the number of triangles and the local curvature grow as t(alpha)e(-beta t2), where alpha and beta parametrize the way geometry changes upon the local density of the walker, and that, in the long run, flatness emerges. Finally, we also prove that the global behavior of the walker, remains the same under spacetime random fluctuations.

An improved electrochemical method was used to reliably determine Pt in estuarine conditions at trace concentrations. Platinum displayed a near-conservative behaviour along the salinity gradient of the estuary, with about 90 % remaining in the dissolved form. Extremely low concentrations of platinum in natural waters require very sensitive analytical techniques, with adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (AdCSV) being one of the most frequently used techniques. A 'fine tuning' of the voltammetric parameters, along with advanced data treatment based on derivative transformations, allowed us to determine reliably Pt levels down to 50 fM (0.05 pM). By using short modulation and interval times of the differential pulse stripping waveform, and applying a 4th derivative transformation to the voltammograms, the limit of detection (LOD) was lowered down to 10 fM. Although very small concentrations of surface-active substances (e.g. 0.025 mg L-1 fulvic acid) strongly influenced the method sensitivity, recoveries of spiked samples were not impacted (similar to 100 %). The application of a desorption step (E-ds = -1.35 V; t(ds) = 2 s) at the end of the accumulation significantly improved the sensitivity, presumably through the removal of adsorbed surface-active substances. Using this optimised methodology, we determined the Pt distribution in the pristine Krka River estuary in the winter and summer periods by performing both horizontal transects and vertical profiles (salinity similar to 1 to 39). In surface waters, dissolved Pt concentrations gradually increased towards the seawater end-member (from similar to 0.15 to similar to 0.3 pM). A small deviation from the conservative mixing line was observed at salinities below 10, which may reflect changes in Pt redox speciation. In bottom waters, the trend was opposite with dissolved Pt concentrations increasing towards the freshwater end-member, probably owing to progressive accumulation related to seawater residence time. On average, 90 % of Pt was present in the dissolved form.

Mathematics and Mechanics of Solids (2003)) and the problem of the synthesis of planar second gradient continua has been faced in several subsequent papers: in dell' Isola et al. Zeitschrift fur angewandte Mathematik and Physik (2015) and dell' Isola et al. Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences (2016). it is considered a three-length-scale microstructure in which two initially orthogonal families of long Euler beams (i.e. beams much longer than the size of the homogenization cell but much slenderer than it) are interconnected by perfect or elastic pivots (hinges). The corresponding homogenized two-dimensional continuum (which was called pantographic sheet) has a D4 orthotropic symmetry. It has been proven to have a deformation energy depending on the second gradient of in-plane displacements and to allow for large elongations in some specific directions while remaining in the elastic regime. However, in pantographic sheets, the deformation energy only depends on the geodesic bending of the actual configuration of its symmetry directions (see for more details Steigmann et al. Acta Mechanica Sinica (2015) [3] and Placidi et al. Journal of Engineering Mathematics (2017) [6]). On the other hand, in Seppecher et al. J. of Physics: Conference Series vol. 319 (2011), it was designed a bi-pantographic architectured sheet where the previously considered Euler beams were replaced by pantographic beams to form a more complex three-length-scale microstructure and it was proven that, once homogenized, such a bi-pantographic sheet, in planar and linearized deformation states, produces a more complete second gradient two-dimensional continuum. Derivatives of elongations along the two symmetry directions now appear in the deformation energy. The aim of the present paper is the experimental validation of the second gradient behavior of such bipantographic sheets. As their intrinsic mechanical structure produces a geometrically non-linear behavior for relatively small total deformation, we first need to extend the homogenization result to the regime of large deformations. Subsequently we compare the predictions obtained using such second gradient model with experimental evidence, as elaborated by local Digital Image Correlation (DIC) focused on the discrete kinematics of the hinges.

The complexity of a physiological signal is usually quantified using entropy estimators, such as Sample Entropy. Recent studies have shown a loss of force signal complexity with the development of neuromuscular fatigue. However, these studies did not consider the stationarity of the force signals which is an important prerequisite of Sample Entropy measurements. Here, we investigated the effect of the potential nonstationarity of force signals on the kinetics of neuromuscular fatigue-induced change in force signal's complexity. Eleven men performed submaximal intermittent isometric contractions of knee extensors until exhaustion. Neuromuscular fatigue was assessed from changes in voluntary and electrically evoked contractions. Sample Entropy values were computed from submaximal force signals throughout the fatiguing task. The Dickey-Fuller test was used to statistically investigate the stationarity of force signals and the Empirical Mode Decomposition was applied to detrend these signals. Maximal voluntary force, central voluntary activation and muscle twitch decreased throughout the task (all p < 0.05), indicating the development of global, central and peripheral fatigue, respectively. We found an increase in Sample Entropy with fatigue (p = 0.024) when not considering the nonstationarity of force signals (i.e., 43% of nonstationary signals). After applying the Empirical Mode Decomposition, we found a decrease in Sample Entropy with fatigue (p = 0.002).

The measurement data are taken at a surface far away from the source support. We prove uniqueness in recovering source terms of the form f(x)g(t) and f(x(1), x(2), t)h(x(3)), where g(t) and h(x(3)) are given and x = (x(1), x(2), x(3)) is the spatial variable in three dimensions. Without these a priori information, we prove that the boundary data of a family of solutions can be used to recover general source terms depending on both time and spatial variables. For moving point sources radiating periodic signals, the data recorded at four receivers are prove sufficient to uniquely recover the orbit function. Simultaneous determination of embedded obstacles and source terms was verified in an inhomogeneous background medium using the observation data of infinite time period. Our approach depends heavily on the Laplace transform.

A novel coupled-mode model for waves propagating in variable bathymetry in the presence of sheared currents								Proceedings in Marine Technology and Ocean Engineering				3				63	69					2020	2020	A novel coupled-mode system is derived for water waves propagating in variable bathymetry regions. The present model includes also scattering effects from inhomogeneous currents. The analysis is based on Euler equations in conjunction with a velocity-based formulation. The vertical expansion of the velocity field is based on a local mode expansion having the property to converge rapidly and satisfy the field equations along with the boundary conditions. The present model extends previous developments for irrotational waves based on a potential formulation presented by Belibassakis et al (2017), supporting the treatment of vorticity effects on the wave field. The dispersion characteristics of the system are studied, and examples are presented illustrating the applicability of this model to various interesting cases of wave-seabed-current interaction.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the interactions involving humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), extracted from Amazonian soils, with Cu(II) and Al (III) ions, using fluorescence quenching spectroscopy. The obtained results showed that the data for the humic fractions of the Amazonian Spodosols could be fitted with one to one complexation model, which provided the best representation of the changes in fluorescence quenching after addition of Cu(II) or Al (III) ions. It was found that the HA presented fewer complexation sites and lower stability constants, compared to the FA samples. Furthermore, the FA showed selective interaction with the metals, while the HA fraction was less selective and could be associated its homogeneous structure. The results showed that the humic acids required 10 times more carbon in their structures than fulvic acids for complexing a metal atom. This behavior can be associated to the fact that the Fulvic Acid fraction has higher mobility and greater interaction during the profile when compare humic acids. Hence, given the diversity of metals to which the HA has affinity, this soil fraction appears to be mainly responsible for soil fertility, while the FA fraction has higher mobility and greater interaction with water.

Effect of the addition of the calcareous algae on the microstructural properties and filtration performances of membranes manufactured from Ghassoul Moroccan clay								CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL				46	1			629	640		10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.015			JAN 2020	2020	Cordierite based membranes were elaborated from a naturally Moroccan clay (Ghassoul) and algae as porosity agent (10 wt%). Specimens devoid of algae were also manufactured and used as reference samples (B1 & B2). To obtain the stoichiometry of cordierite, alumina and silica gel were added to the employed clay. After calcination at 600 degrees C, the mixture was heat treated according to two different thermal cycles. The first one consisted of a single thermal treatment at 1250 degrees C after the addition of the algae (BALI). As for the second, two heat treatments were carried out at 1250 degrees C separated by the addition of the algae BAL2. Several techniques were used to characterize the cordierite membrane performances such as X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscope, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and microscope impedance spectroscopy. Porosity and filtration suitability were assessed and correlated to the morphology. It has been proved that stevensite, dolomite and quartz were involved in the neoformation process and melt respectively. SEM examinations showed different features that exhibited different sized pores alongside with some melted zones. Algae addition contributed to the formation of pores in algae containing samples compared to the reference specimens. At room temperature, filtration tests were performed using textile effluent in order to reduce the turbidity, BOD and the chemical oxygen demand. The results showed that their percentages decreased by more than 60% after filtration. In addition, dielectric measurements revealed that the sintering process was effective beyond 1000 degrees C and it was accompanied with a low activation energy. Manufactured ceramic membranes are expected to have challenge application in the treatment of wastewater.

Model-independent search for neutrino sources with the ANTARES neutrino telescope								ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS				114				35	47		10.1016/j.astropartphys.2019.06.003			JAN 2020	2020	A novel method to analyse the spatial distribution of neutrino candidates recorded with the ANTARES neutrino telescope is introduced, searching for an excess of neutrinos in a region of arbitrary size and shape from any direction in the sky. Techniques originating from the domains of machine learning, pattern recognition and image processing are used to purify the sample of neutrino candidates and for the analysis of the obtained skymap. In contrast to a dedicated search for a specific neutrino emission model, this approach is sensitive to a wide range of possible morphologies of potential sources of high-energy neutrino emission. The application of these methods to ANTARES data yields a large-scale excess with a post-trial significance of 2.5 sigma. Applied to public data from IceCube in its IC40 configuration, an excess consistent with the results from ANTARES is observed with a post-trial significance of 2.1 sigma. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In order to control rumor propagation, spreading correct information to counterbalance the effect of the rumor seems more appropriate than simply blocking rumors by censorship or network disruption. In this paper, a competitive diffusion model, namely Linear Threshold model with One Direction state Transition (LT1DT), is proposed for modeling competitive information propagation of two different types in the same network. The problem of minimizing rumor spread in social networks is explored and a novel heuristic based on diffusion dynamics is proposed to solve this problem under the LT1DT. Experimental analysis on four different networks shows that the novel heuristic outperforms pagerank centrality. By seeding correct information in the proximity of rumor seeds, the novel heuristic performs as well as the greedy approach in scale-free and small-world networks but runs three orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approach.
