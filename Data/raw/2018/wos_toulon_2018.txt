J	Luce, Hubert; Kantha, Lakshmi; Hashiguchi, Hiroyuki; Lawrence, Dale; Doddi, Abhiram								Turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rates estimated from concurrent UAV and MU radar measurements								EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE				70						207	10.1186/s40623-018-0979-1			DEC 27 2018	2018	We tested models commonly used for estimating turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rates epsilon from very high frequency stratosphere-troposphere radar data. These models relate the root-mean-square value sigma of radial velocity fluctuations assessed from radar Doppler spectra to epsilon. For this purpose, we used data collected from the middle and upper atmosphere (MU) radar during the Shigaraki unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)radar experiment campaigns carried out at the Shigaraki MU Observatory, Japan, in June 2016 and 2017. On these occasions, UAVs equipped with fast-response and low-noise Pitot tube sensors for turbulence measurements were operated in the immediate vicinity of the MU radar. Radar-derived dissipation rates epsilon estimated from the various models at a range resolution of 150m from the altitude of 1.345km up to the altitude of 4.0km, a (half width half power) beam aperture of 1.32 degrees and a time resolution of 24.6s, were compared to dissipation rates (epsilon U) directly obtained from relative wind speed spectra inferred from UAV measurements. Firstly, statistical analysis results revealed a very close relationship between enhancements of sigma and epsilon U for epsilon Us-3, indicating that both instruments detected the same turbulent events with epsilon U above this threshold. Secondly, epsilon U was found to be statistically proportional to sigma 3, whereas a sigma 2 dependence is expected when the size of the largest turbulent eddies is smaller than the longitudinal and transverse dimensions of the radar sampling volume. The sigma 3 dependence was found even after excluding convectively generated turbulence in the planetary boundary layer and below clouds. The best agreement between epsilon U and radar-derived epsilon was obtained with the simple formulation based on dimensional analysis epsilon=sigma 3/Lc where L-C approximate to 50-70m. This empirical expression constitutes a simple way to estimate dissipation rates in the lower troposphere from MU radar data whatever the sources of turbulence be, in clear air or cloudy conditions, consistent with UAV estimates.

Experiments were performed in pH-controlled Stirred Tank Reactor (STR) with or without the addition of nitrogen and sulfur sources. The total H-2 production and the maximum hydrogen productivity of T. maritima in the culture medium, containing MFVW and AHFW (45 mmol L-1 carbohydrates) at a C/N ratio of 12, were 132 mmol L-1 and 15 mmol h(-1) L-1, respectively. However, tripling the concentration of carbohydrates to reach a C/N ratio of 22, has increased two times the maximum H-2 productivity (28 mmol h(-1) L-1) due to the improvement in nutrient balance. The cumulative H-2 production was 285 mmol L-1, yielding a potential energy generation of 0.1210(3) MJ ton(-1) wastes, which could be an interesting alternative for energy recovery.

Small-scale dynamics and turbulence in the first 800m surface layer were characterized based on hydrographic and current measurements at fine vertical scale and turbulence measurements at centimeter scale using a vertical microstructure profiler. The possible impact of turbulence on biogeochemical budgets in the surface layer was also addressed in this region of increasing oligotrophy to the east. The dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, epsilon, showed an interesting contrast along the longitudinal transect with stronger turbulence in the west, i.e., the Melanesian Archipelago, compared to the east, within the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre, with a variation of epsilon by a factor of 3 within [100-500 m]. The layer with enhanced turbulence decreased in vertical extent travelling eastward. This spatial pattern was correlated with the energy level of the internal wave field, higher in the west compared to the east. The difference in wave energy mostly resulted from enhanced wind power input into inertial motions in the west. Moreover, three long-duration stations were sampled along the cruise transect, each over three inertial periods. The analysis from the western long-duration station gave evidence of an energetic baroclinic near-inertial wave that was responsible for the enhanced epsilon observed within a 50-250 m layer, with a value of 8 x 10(-9) Wkg(-1), about 8 times larger than at the eastern long-duration stations. Averaged nitrate turbulent diffusive fluxes in a 100 m layer below the top of the nitracline were about twice larger west of 170 degrees W due to the higher vertical diffusion coefficient. In the photic layer, the depthaveraged nitrate turbulent diffusive flux strongly decreased eastward, with an averaged value of 11 mu molm 2d(-1) west of 170 degrees Wcompared with the 3 mu molm(-2)d(-1) averaged value east of 170 degrees W. Contrastingly, phosphate turbulent diffusive fluxes were significantly larger in the photic layer. This input may have an important role in sustaining the development of N-2-fixing organisms that were shown to be the main primary contributors to the biological pump in the area. The timespace intermittency of mixing events, intrinsic to turbulence, was underlined, but its consequences for micro-organisms would deserve a dedicated study.

The results show that C-60 is chemisorbed by orbital hybridization between the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the p(z) orbital of Si adatom at the apex of the tetramers. The covalent nature of the bonding was inferred from core level as well as valence band spectra. The Si 2p spectra reveal that a large fraction (at least 45%) of the Si adatoms remain unbound despite the reactive character of the associated dangling bonds. This is consistent with a model in which each C-60 is attached to the substrate through a single covalent C-60-Si bond. A binding energy shift of the core levels associated with sub-surface Si or C atoms indicates a decrease of the SiC band bending caused by a charge transfer from the C-60 molecules to the substrate via the formation of donor-like interface states.

The goals of this expedition were to investigate serpentinization processes and microbial activity in the shallow subsurface of highly altered ultramafic and mafic sequences that have been uplifted to the seafloor along a major detachment fault zone. More than 57 m of core were recovered, with borehole penetration ranging from 1.3 to 16.4 meters below seafloor, and core recovery as high as 75% of total penetration in one borehole. The cores show highly heterogeneous rock types and alteration associated with changes in bulk rock chemistry that reflect multiple phases of magmatism, fluid-rock interaction and mass transfer within the detachment fault zone. Recovered ultramafic rocks are dominated by pervasively serpentinized harzburgite with intervals of serpentinized dunite and minor pyroxenite veins; gabbroic rocks occur as melt impregnations and veins. Dolerite intrusions and basaltic rocks represent the latest magmatic activity. The proportion of mafic rocks is volumetrically less than the amount of mafic rocks recovered previously by drilling the central dome of Atlantis Massif at IODP Site U1309. This suggests a different mode of melt accumulation in the mantle peridotites at the ridge-transform intersection and/or a tectonic transposition of rock types within a complex detachment fault zone. The cores revealed a high degree of serpentinization and metasomatic alteration dominated by talc-amphibole-chlorite overprinting. Metasomatism is most prevalent at contacts between ultramafic and mafic domains (gabbroic and/or doleritic intrusions) and points to channeled fluid flow and silica mobility during exhumation along the detachment fault. The presence of the mafic lenses within the serpentinites and their alteration to mechanically weak talc, serpentine and chlorite may also be critical in the development of the detachment fault zone and may aid in continued unroofing of the upper mantle peridotite/gabbro sequences. New technologies were also developed for the seabed drills to enable biogeochemical and microbiological characterization of the environment. An in situ sensor package and water sampling system recorded real-time variations in dissolved methane, oxygen, pH, oxidation reduction potential (Eh), and temperature and during drilling and sampled bottom water after drilling. Systematic excursions in these parameters together with elevated hydrogen and methane concentrations in post-drilling fluids provide evidence for active serpentinization at all sites. In addition, chemical tracers were delivered into the drilling fluids for contamination testing, and a borehole plug system was successfully deployed at some sites for future fluid sampling. A major achievement of IODP Expedition 357 was to obtain microbiological samples along a west-east profile, which will provide a better understanding of how microbial communities evolve as ultramafic and mafic rocks are altered and emplaced on the seafloor. Strict sampling handling protocols allowed for very low limits of microbial cell detection, and our results show that the Atlantis Massif subsurface contains a relatively low density of microbial life.

Meso-zooplankton structure and functioning in the western tropical South Pacific along the 20th parallel south during the OUTPACE survey (February-April 2015)								BIOGEOSCIENCES				15	23			7273	7297		10.5194/bg-15-7273-2018			DEC 10 2018	2018	The western tropical South Pacific (WTSP) is one of the most understudied oceanic regions in terms of the planktonic food web, despite supporting some of the largest tuna fisheries in the world. In this stratified oligotrophic ocean, nitrogen fixation may play an important role in supporting the plankton food web and higher trophic level production. In the austral summer (February-April) of 2015, the OUTPACE (Oligotrophy to UlTra-oligotrophy PACific Experiment) project conducted a comprehensive survey of 4000 km along 20 degrees S, from New Caledonia to Tahiti, to determine the role of N-2 fixation on biogeochemical cycles and food web structure in this region. Here, we characterize the zooplankton community and plankton food web processes at 15 short-duration stations (8 h each) to describe the large-scale variability across trophic gradients from oligotrophic waters around Melanesian archipelagoes (MAs) to ultra-oligotrophic waters of the South Pacific gyre (GY). Three long-duration stations (5 days each) enabled a more detailed analysis of processes and were positioned (1) in offshore northern waters of New Caledonia (MA), (2) near Niue Island (MA), and (3) in the subtropical Pacific gyre (GY) near the Cook Islands. At all stations, meso-zooplankton was sampled with a bongo net with 120 mu m mesh size to estimate abundance, biomass, community taxonomy and size structure, and size fractionated delta N-15. Subsequently, we estimated zooplankton carbon demand, grazing impact, excretion rates, and the contribution of diazotroph-derived nitrogen (DDN) to zooplankton biomass. The meso-zooplankton community showed a general decreasing trend in abundance and biomass from west to east, with a clear drop in the GY waters. Higher abundance and biomass corresponded to higher primary production associated with complex mesoscale circulation in the Coral Sea and between 170-180 degrees W. The taxonomic structure showed a high degree of similarity in terms of species richness and abundance distribution across the whole region, with, however, a moderate difference in the GY region, where the copepod contribution to meso-zooplankton increased. The calculated ingestion and metabolic rates allowed us to estimate that the top-down (grazing) and bottom-up (excretion of nitrogen and phosphorous) impact of zooplankton on phytoplankton was potentially high. Daily grazing pressure on phytoplankton stocks was estimated to remove 19% to 184% of the total daily primary production and 1.5% to 22% of fixed N-2. The top-down impact of meso-zooplankton was higher in the eastern part of the transect, including GY, than in the Coral Sea region and was mainly exerted on nano- and micro-phytoplankton. The regeneration of nutrients by zooplankton excretion was high, suggesting a strong contribution to regenerated production, particularly in terms of N. Daily NH4+ excretion accounted for 14.5% to 165% of phytoplankton needs for N, whereas PO43- excretion accounted for only 2.8% to 34% of P needs. From zooplankton delta N-15 values, we estimated that the DDN contributed to up to 67% and 75% to the zooplankton biomass in the western and central parts of the MA regions, respectively, but strongly decreased to an average of 22% in the GY region and down to 7% in the easternmost station. Thus, the highest contribution of diazotrophic microorganisms to zooplankton biomass occurred in the region of highest N-2 fixation rates and when Trichodesmium dominated the diazotrophs community (MA waters). Our estimations of the fluxes associated with zooplankton were highly variable between stations and zones but very high in most cases compared to literature data, partially due to the high contribution of small forms. The highest values encountered were found at the boundary between the oligotrophic (MA) and ultra-oligotrophic regions (GY). Within the MA zone, the high variability of the top-down and bottom-up impact was related to the high mesoscale activity in the physical environment. Estimated zooplankton respiration rates relative to primary production were among the highest cited values at similar latitudes, inducing a high contribution of migrant zooplankton respiration to carbon flux. Despite the relatively low biomass values of planktonic components in quasi-steady state, the availability of micro- and macronutrients related to physical mesoscale patterns in the waters surrounding the MA, the fueling by DDN, and the relatively high rates of plankton production and metabolism estimated during OUTPACE may explain the productive food chain ending with valuable fisheries in this region.

If these coatings are very good absorbers in the visible and near-infrared range, they can also be of interest for reaching light confinement regimes where nonlocality arises strongly, or for designing molecular electronics junctions embedded in resonating cavities. Here both modeling and experimental realization of a nanocube assembly approach based on alkyldithiols molecules is proposed that enables a high reproducibility on the resonance position of the cavities, as well as gaps that are thinner than the usual 3 nm limit often reported in the literature, thus opening the way to experimental confirmation of nonlocal effects as well as new perspectives for molecular electronics.

In particular, relevant information can be extracted from the noise signal in generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments, where Levitons with different charges collide against each other at a quantum point contact. We describe this quantity both in the framework of the photo-assisted noise formalism and in terms of a very interesting and transparent picture based on wave-packet overlap.

Among them, bilirubin oxidases are copper-based enzymes that reduce oxygen into water with low overpotentials. The factors that ensure electrocatalytic efficiency of the enzyme in the immobilized state are not well understood, however. In this work, we use a multiple methodological approach on a wide range of pH values for protein adsorption and electrocatalysis to demonstrate the effect of electrostatic interactions on the electrical wiring, dynamics, and stability of a bilirubin oxidase adsorbed on self-assembled-monolayers on gold. We show on one hand that the global charge of the enzyme controls the loading on the interface and that the specific activity of the immobilized enzyme decreases with the enzyme coverage. On the other hand, we show that the dipole moment of the protein and the charge in the vicinity of the Cu site acting as the entry point of electrons drive the enzyme orientation. In case of weak electrostatic interactions, we demonstrate that local pH variation affects the electron transfer rate as a result of protein mobility on the surface. On the contrary, stronger electrostatic interactions destabilize the protein structure and affect the stability of the catalytic signal. These data illustrate the interplay between immobilized protein dynamics and local environment that control the efficiency of bioelectro catalysis.

Strain SEBR 4209(T) is phylogenetically related to the genus Pleomorphochaeta, in the family Spirochaetaceae. Its closest relatives are Pleomorphochaeta caudata SEBR 4223(T) (94.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Pleomorphochaeta multiformis MO-SPC21 (94.3 % similarity). Like the other members of this genus, cells have a pleomorphic morphology, in particular an annular shape and long stalks. Optimal growth was observed at 37 degrees C, at pH between 6.8 and 7.0, and with 40 g l(-1) NaCl. This strain was only able to grow by fermentation of carbohydrates. The fermentation products from glucose utilization were acetate, ethanol, CO2 and H-2. Predominant fatty acids were C-14:0, C-14:0 DMA, C-1(6:)0 and C-1(6):(1)omega 7c. The major polar lipids were phosphoglycolipids, phospholipids and glycolipids. The G+C content of the DNA was 29.6 mol%. Based on phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic traits, strain SEBR 4209(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Pleomorphochaeta, for which the name Pleomorphochaeta naphthae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SEBR 4209(T) (=DSM 104684(T)=JCM 31871(T)).

Impacts on the BaP detection are discussed according to: 1) the addition or no of 4-vinylpyridine (4VP) as comonomer, 2) the use of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) or divinylbenzene (DVB) as crosslinker. After characterization, these new e-MIPs and their corresponding non-imprinted polymers (e-NIPs) were incorporated in carbon paste electrodes and measurements were carried out by square wave voltammetry. All analyses revealed that e-MIP based on VFc and EDMA is the best to detect the template, with an imprinting factor of 7.3 and a LOD of 0.93 mu mol/L of BaP.

This PDMS/polyester network is expected to maintain a low surface energy during water immersion while, at the same time, ensuring a continuous renewal of its surface through an erosion process. The PDMS/polyester networks were crosslinked via a condensation reaction of a bis-silanol PDMS oil and various bis(trialkoxysilane)-terminated polyester macrocrosslinkers. Chain ends of poly(epsilon-caprolactone), poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-b-PDMS-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) and poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) were quantitatively functionalized using (3-iso-cyanatopropyl) trimethoxysilane as crosslinking reactant. These polyester macrocrosslinkers were highly inserted in the PDMS-based networks in quantities ranging from 12 to 40 wt.%. The microtopography of these PDMS/polyester coatings revealed relatively low roughness values for most of the coatings. Contact angle measurements highlighted an increase of hydrophilicity for PCL-based coatings contrary to the poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)-based coating which demonstrated a surface hydrophobicity as well as a low surface free energy (gamma(s) <= 25 mJ/m(2)) even after 5 weeks of immersion in deionized water. The insertion of polyesters within a silicone matrix affected both the elastic modulus and the cristallinity of the network depending on the polyester nature. Finally, mass loss tests demonstrated that these PDMS/polyester coatings had the ability to erode themselves.

One of the main objectives of this study was to develop an ageing test able to predict long-term antifouling coating performances in less than one year with a mechanism which is representative to the natural ageing. One self-polishing copolymer (SPC)-based coating and one controlled depletion polymer (CDP)-based coating were selected because of their well-known distinct mechanisms of action. Five static artificial conditions were used in cycles and their influence on the ageing of two coatings was investigated. Comparison of two key parameters such as erosion of the coatings and formation of a leached layer or a depleted layer at the surface of the two coatings were investigated in accelerated and in situ tests. Results support the different mode of action of the two coatings. The static artificial conditions were shown to affect the residual antifouling efficiency differently. Deionized water buffered at pH = 8 with tris(hydrozymethyl)methylamine was the only static artificial condition that led to an acceleration of both the formation of a leached layer or a depleted layer at the surface of the two coatings and their erosion.

Low-temperature intrinsic plasticity in silicon at small scales								ACTA MATERIALIA				161				54	60		10.1016/j.actamat.2018.09.025			DEC 2018	2018	The mechanical properties of materials usually depend on the size of the considered object. Silicon, for instance, undergoes between the macroscopic and nanometer scales, a brittle-to-ductile transition at room temperature. Although essential for the constantly developing Si-based nanotechnologies, the origin of this remarkable behaviour change remains undetermined for several years. The observation of the mechanisms responsible for plastic deformation in nano-objects is indeed highly challenging at the microscopic scale. One needs controlling the deformation while identifying induced individual plastic events at the smallest scale during the first stages of plasticity. This work describes nano-compression experiments on 100 nm-diameter Si nanopillars followed by post-mortem analysis of the deformed specimens through SEM and atomic resolution TEM imaging. The observed plastic deformation disrupts the usual description of low-temperature undissociated-dislocations-mediated plasticity and is comforted by molecular dynamics calculations. These results shed a new light on the transition between ductile and brittle regimes in silicon by introducing the missing link between plasticity and fracture. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

Thus, neutrinos are a unique messenger offering the opportunity to test the products of Galactic cosmic-ray interactions up to energies of hundreds of TeV. Here we present a search for this production using ten years of Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope and Abyss environmental RESearch (ANTARES) track and shower data, as well as seven years of IceCube track data. The data are combined into a joint likelihood test for neutrino emission according to the KRA(gamma) model assuming a 5 PeV per nucleon Galactic cosmic-ray cutoff. No significant excess is found. As a consequence, the limits presented in this Letter start constraining the model parameter space for Galactic cosmic-ray production and transport.		[Albert, A.; Drouhin, D.; Ruiz, R.

J	Doh, Yann; Delfour, Fabienne; Augier, Elodie; Glotin, Herve; Graff, Christian; Adam, Olivier								Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) sonar slacks off before touching a non-alimentary target								BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES				157				337	345		10.1016/j.beproc.2018.07.015			DEC 2018	2018	Odontocetes modulate the rhythm of their echolocation clicks to draw information about their environment. When they approach preys to capture, they speed up their emissions to increase the sampling rate of "distant touch" and improve information update. This global acceleration turns into a "terminal buzz" also described in bats, which is a click train with drastic increase in rate, just as reaching the prey. This study documents and analyses under human care bottlenose dolphins' echolocation activity, when approaching non-alimentary targets. Four dolphins' locomotor and clicking behaviours were recorded during training sessions, when sent to immersed objects pointed by their trainers. Results illustrate that these dolphins profusely use echolocation towards immersed non-alimentary objects. They accelerate click emission when approaching the target, thus displaying a classical terminal buzz. However, their terminal buzz slackens off within a quarter of second before the end of click train. Typically, they decelerate to stop clicking just before they touch the object using their rostrum lower tip. They do not emit clicks as the contact lasts. In conclusion, when exploring inert objects, bottlenose dolphins under human accelerate clicking like other odontocetes or bats approaching preys. Bottlenose dolphins' particular slackening-off profile at the end of the buzz shows that they anticipate the moment of direct contact, and they stop just as real touch relays distant touch of the object.

A soil was submitted to SS amendment only, another to TWW irrigation only, another to both treatments, and another was not submitted to any of these treatments. We found that the agronomic quality of the treated soils has not decreased. In treated soils, it was observed a slight increase of pH, an increase of the cation exchange capacity, and no change of either salinity or electrical conductivity. Sodium adsorption ratio and exchangeable sodium percentage remained satisfactory, below 13 and 15, respectively, and no infiltration problems were observed, indicating that rainwater percolation was sufficient to leach the salt brought by SS or TWW. The soil organic matter (SOM) increased in all SS-amended and/or TWW irrigated soils, the increase being higher in SS-amended soils. The SOM kept a satisfactory C/N ratio, lower than 15; the SUVA (Specific UV Absorbance) and E2/E3 index showed normal characteristics of the water-extracted organic matter (WEOC). Both SS amendment and TWW irrigation brought high amounts of nutrients in the considered soils and increased the nutrients disponibility, especially regarding K and P, as shown by the nutrient concentrations in the soil water extracts. The pH increase does not seem to be a problem for the bioavailability of trace elements, at least regarding Cu, Zn, Co, and Fe. Complementary studies should be undertaken for Ni. These observations highlight the potential agronomical benefits of application of wastewater and sewage sludge, even without great technicality, the better results being obtained using both SS amendment and TWW irrigation.

Strain Distribution Induced in SOI Photonic Substrate by Through Silicon via Using Advanced Scanning X-Ray Nano-Diffraction								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEVICE AND MATERIALS RELIABILITY				18	4			529	533		10.1109/TDMR.2018.2881418			DEC 2018	2018	In 3-D integration, dice are vertically interconnected with through silicon via (TSV), which consist of holes etched in a thinned silicon substrate and filled with copper. This process induces thermal strain in surrounding silicon. New trends in 3-D integration imply the fabrication of Si photonic devices like waveguides in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates containing TSVs. Thus, a quantitative analysis of strain in active areas around TSVs is mandatory. In this paper, the strain induced by the TSVs in both the bulk silicon and the SOI layer was investigated by using advanced scanning X-ray nano-diffraction. The crystallographic orientation offset between the separated silicon areas allows decorrelation of the strain in the Si layer of the SOI and Si substrate. Using synchrotron radiation, 2-D quicK continuous mapping of the strain in a region of 50 mu m x 50 mu m with 500 nm spatial resolution was performed around a single TSV at room temperature and during in-situ annealing at 460 degrees C. The strain field induced by the TSV appears negligible in both silicon areas. The effect of in-situ annealing on the strain distribution is surprisingly weak. In the SOI active layer, the strain map mimics the surface pattern generated by the photonic devices processed at high temperature in this thin layer.

Severe damages have been reported in biota and population, which depends on the Subae river watershed quality for agriculture, fishing, and shellfish harvesting. This study aims to understand the geochemical characteristics and dynamics of the river close to the former Pb smelter. The river was sampled at eight sites upstream and eight sites downstream the smelter, near the estuary in the Todos os Santos Bay, six times during a year. Immediate analyses were performed by multiprobe. Major ions were measured by chromatography, dissolved metals by ICP-OES in the filtrated samples (0.45m), and particulate metals >0.45m by EDX spectrometry. The ions Na+ and HCO3- are dominated in the river. Most of the samples (47.6%) were classified as sodic, due to oceanic saline intrusion during tide. Despite the high pollution caused by the smelter from 1960 to 1993, still observed in the surrounding soils, dissolved and particulate metals in the river remained low in all sites during the entire year. Only Cu presented some concentration above the threshold of the Brazilian regulations. The discharge of metals by the river into the Todos os Santos Bay appears to be low for Pb and Zn (2.2 and 14.3kgkm(-1)year(-1), respectively), but higher for Cu comparatively to other worldwide bays.

J	Ami, Dominique; Aprahamian, Frederic; Chanel, Olivier; Luchini, Stephane								When do social cues and scientific information affect stated preferences? Insights from an experiment on air pollution								JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING				29				33	46		10.1016/j.jocm.2018.09.001			DEC 2018	2018	Stated preference surveys are usually carried out in one session, without any follow-up interview after respondents have had the opportunity to experience the public goods or policies they were asked to value. Consequently, a stated preference survey needs to be designed so as to provide respondents with all the relevant information, and to help them process this information so they can perform the valuation exercise properly. In this paper, we study experimentally an elicitation procedure in which respondents are provided with a sequence of different types of information (social cues and objective information) that allows them to sequentially revise their willingness-to-pay (WTP) values. Our experiment was carried out in large groups using an electronic voting system which allows us to construct social cues in real time. To analyse the data, we developed an anchoring-type structural model that allows us to estimate the direct effect (at the current round) and the indirect effect (on subsequent rounds) of information. Our results shed new light on the interacted effect of social cues and objective information: social cues have little or no direct effect on WTP values but they have a strong indirect effect on how respondents process scientific information. Social cues have the most noticeable effect on respondents who initially report a WTP below the group average but only after receiving additional objective information about the valuation task. We suggest that the construction and the provision of social cues should be added to the list of tools and controls for stated preference methods.

In the context of decompression sickness (DCS), the course of which is sometimes erratic, we hypothesize that mtDNA plays a not insignificant role particularly in neurological type accidents. This study is based on the comparison of circulating mtDNA levels in humans presenting with various types of diving accidents, and punctured upon their admission at the hyperbaric facility. One hundred and fourteen volunteers took part in the study. According to the clinical criteria there were 12 Cerebro DCS, 57 Medullary DCS, 15 Vestibular DCS, 8 Ctrl+ (accident-free divers), and 22 Ctrl- (non-divers). This work demonstrates that accident-free divers have less mtDNA than non-divers, which leads to the assumption that hyperbaric exposure degrades the mtDNA. mtDNA levels are on average greater in divers with DCS compared with accident-free divers. On another hand, the amount of double strand DNA (dsDNA) is neither significantly different between controls, nor between the different DCS types. Initially the increase in circulating oligonucleotides was attributed to the destruction of cells by bubble abrasion following necrotic phenomena. If there really is a significant difference between the Medullary DCS and the Ctrl-, this difference is not significant between these same DCS and the Ctrl+. This refutes the idea of massive degassing and suggests the need for new research in order to verify that oxidative stress could be a key element without necessarily being sufficient for the occurrence of a neurological type of accident.

J	Petri, Giovanni; Barrat, Alain								Simplicial Activity Driven Model								PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS				121	22					228301	10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.228301			NOV 29 2018	2018	Many complex systems find a convenient representation in terms of networks: structures made by pairwise interactions (links) of elements (nodes). For many biological and social systems, elementary interactions involve, however, more than two elements, and simplicial complexes are more adequate to describe such phenomena. Moreover, these interactions often change over time. Here, we propose a framework to model such an evolution: the simplicial activity driven model, in which the building block is a simplex of nodes representing a multiagent interaction. We show analytically and numerically that the use of simplicial structures leads to crucial structural differences with respect to the activity driven model, a paradigmatic temporal network model involving only binary interactions. It also impacts the outcome of paradigmatic processes modeling disease propagation or social contagion. In particular, fluctuations in the number of nodes involved in the interactions can affect the outcome of models of simple contagion processes, contrarily to what happens in the activity driven model.

Methods: Thirteen male trail runners habituated to regular eccentric training performed two separate 40-min downhill running (DHR, -8.5 degrees) sessions while wearing either CGs (15-20 mmHg for quadriceps and calves) or control garments (CON) at a velocity associated with similar to 55% of VO2max, with a set of measurements before (Pre-), after (Post-DHR), and 1 day after (Post-1D). No CGs was used within the recovery phase. Perceived muscle soreness, countermovement jump, and neuromuscular function (central and peripheral components) of knee extensors (KE) and plantar flexors (PF) were assessed. Cardiorespiratory responses (e.g., heart rate, ventilation) and RE, as well as soft-tissue vibrations (root mean square of the resultant acceleration, RMS A(r)) for vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius medialls were evaluated during DHR and in Post-1D. Results: During DHR, mean values in RMS A(r) significantly increased over time for the vastus lateralis only for the CON condition (+11.6%). RE and cardiorespiratory responses significantly increased (i.e., alteration) over time in both conditions. Post-DHR small to very large central and peripheral alterations were found for KE and PF in both conditions. However, the deficit in voluntary activation (VA) was significantly lower for KE following CGs (-2.4%), compared to CON (-7.9%) conditions. No significant differences in perceived muscle soreness and countermovement jump were observed between conditions whatever the time period. Additionally, in Post-1D, the CGs condition showed reductions in neuromuscular peripheral alterations only for KE (from -4.4 to -7.7%) and perceived muscle soreness scores (-8.3%). No significant differences in cardiorespiratory and RE responses as well as countermovement jump were identified between conditions in Post-1D. Discussion: Wearing high-pressure COs (notably on KE) during DHR was associated with beneficial effects on soft-tissue vibrations, acute and delayed neuromuscular function, and perceived muscle soreness. The use of CGs during DHR might contribute to the enhanced muscle recovery by exerting an exercise-induced "mechanical protective effect."

A 29-year record of in situ observations was used to examine episodic peaks in POC fluxes and sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC) at Station M (NE Pacific, 4,000-m depth). From 1989 to 2017, 19% of POC flux at 3,400 m arrived during high-magnitude episodic events (>= mean + 2 sigma), and 43% from 2011 to 2017. From 2011 to 2017, when high-resolution SCOC data were available, time lags between changes in satellite-estimated export flux (EF), POC flux, and SCOC on the sea floor varied between six flux events from 0 to 70 days, suggesting variable remineralization rates and/or particle sinking speeds. Half of POC flux pulse events correlated with prior increases in EF and/or subsequent SCOC increases. Peaks in EF overlying Station M frequently translated to changes in POC flux at abyssal depths. A power-law model (Martin curve) was used to estimate abyssal fluxes from EF and midwater temperature variation. While the background POC flux at 3,400-m depth was described well by the model, the episodic events were significantly underestimated by similar to 80% and total flux by almost 50%. Quantifying episodic pulses of organic carbon into the deep sea is critical in modeling the depth and intensity of POC sequestration and understanding the global carbon cycle.

The simultaneous treatment of unpolarized and polarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) allows a determination of thermodynamical potentials (the master parameters of the model) which drive their behavior and consequently the behavior of the structure functions. The existence of a possible relation between the gluon and a q (q) over bar pair leads to define a toy model for the unpolarized and polarized gluons. In view of forthcoming experimental results in the large-x region, specific predictions made by the model are presented.

The white hole acts as a long-lived remnant, providing a possible resolution to the information paradox. The remnant solution of the paradox has long been viewed with suspicion, mostly because remnants seemed to be such exotic objects. We point out that (i) established physics includes objects with precisely the required properties for remnants: white holes with small masses but large finite interiors; (ii) non-perturbative quantum gravity indicates that a black hole tunnels precisely into such a white hole, at the end of its evaporation. We address the objections to the existence of white-hole remnants, discuss their stability, and show how the notions of entropy relevant in this context allow them to evade several no-go arguments. A black hole's formation, evaporation, tunneling to a white hole, and final slow decay, form a unitary process that does not violate any known physics.

Three-point bending behavior of a Au nanowire studied by in-situ Laue micro-diffraction								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				124	18					185104	10.1063/1.5054068			NOV 14 2018	2018	The elastic and plastic deformation of a gold nanowire tested in a three-point bending configuration using the custom-built scanning force microscope SFINX was studied in situ by Laue micro-diffraction. A new data treatment method based on the integration of diffraction patterns recorded along the deformed nanostructure is introduced visualizing both the movement and shape of the diffraction peaks as a function of the measurement position. Besides bending, torsion is evidenced during the elastic deformation originating from a misalignment of the SFINX-tip of the order of 60 nm with respect to the nanowire center. As demonstrated by post-mortem Laue micro-diffraction maps, the plastic deformation is governed by the storage of geometrically necessary dislocations. Analyzing the shape of the diffraction peaks, the activation of two unexpected slip systems is found which does not coincide with the slip systems with the highest resolved shear stress. These unexpected slip systems are probably related to the dislocation nucleation process at the clamping point, which is influenced by the local curvature. Published by AIP Publishing.

J	Gimenez, Audrey; Baklouti, Melika; Wagener, Thibaut; Moutin, Thierry								Diazotrophy as the main driver of the oligotrophy gradient in the western tropical South Pacific Ocean: results from a one-dimensional biogeochemical-physical coupled model								BIOGEOSCIENCES				15	21			6573	6589		10.5194/bg-15-6573-2018			NOV 7 2018	2018	The Oligotrophy to UlTra-oligotrophy PACific Experiment (OUTPACE) cruise took place in the western tropical South Pacific (WTSP) during the austral summer (March-April 2015). The aim of the OUTPACE project was to investigate a longitudinal gradient of biological and biogeochemical features in the WTSP, and especially the role of N-2 fixation in the C, N, and P cycles. Two contrasted regions were considered in this study: the Western Melanesian Archipelago (WMA), characterized by high N-2 fixation rates, significant surface production and low dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations, and the South Pacific Gyre (WGY), characterized by very low N-2 fixation rates, surface production and high DIP concentrations. Since physical forcings and mixed layer dynamics in both regions were similar, it was considered that the gradient of oligotrophy observed in situ between the WMA and WGY was not explained by differences in physical processes, but rather by differences in biogeochemical processes. A one-dimensional physical-biogeochemical coupled model was used to investigate the role of N-2 fixation in the WTSP by running two identical simulations, only differing by the presence (sim(WMA)) or absence (sim(WGY)) of diazotrophs. We showed that the nitracline and the phosphacline had to be, respectively, deeper and shallower than the mixed layer depth (MLD) to bring N-depleted and P-repleted waters to the surface during winter mixing, thereby creating favorable conditions for the development of diazotrophs. We also concluded that a preferential regeneration of the detrital phosphorus (P) matter was necessary to obtain this gap between the nitracline and phosphacline depths, as the nutricline depths significantly depend on the regeneration of organic matter in the water column. Moreover, the model enabled us to highlight the presence of seasonal variations in primary production and P availability in the upper surface waters in simWMA, where diazotrophs provided a new source of nitrogen (N) to the ecosystem, whereas no seasonal variations were obtained in simWGY, in the absence of diazotrophs. These main results emphasized the fact that surface production dynamics in the WTSP is based on a complex and sensitive system which depends on the one hand on physical processes (vertical mixing, sinking of detrital particles), and on the other hand on biogeochemical processes (N-2 fixation, remineralization).

Archaea constitute a third domain of life, and are currently not used as probiotics, despite several interesting features. This includes the absence of known pathogens in humans, animals, or plants and the existence of some archaea closely associated to humans in various microbiomes. We promote the concept that some specific archaea that naturally thrive in the human gut are potential next- generation probiotics that can be rationally selected on the basis of their metabolic phenotype not being encountered in other human gut microbes, neither Bacteria nor Eukarya. The example of the possible bioremediation of the proatherogenic compound trimethylamine into methane by archaeal microbes is described.

J	Kantha, Lakshmi; Luce, Hubert								Mixing Coefficient in Stably Stratified Flows								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY				48	11			2649	2665		10.1175/JPO-D-18-0139.1			NOV 2018	2018	Turbulent mixing in the interior of the oceans is not as well understood as mixing in the oceanic boundary layers. Mixing in the generally stably stratified interior is primarily, although not exclusively, due to intermittent shear instabilities. Part of the energy extracted by the Reynolds stresses acting on the mean shear is expended in increasing the potential energy of the fluid column through a buoyancy flux, while most of it is dissipated. The mixing coefficient (m), the ratio of the buoyancy flux to the dissipation rate of turbulence kinetic energy epsilon, is an important parameter, since knowledge of (m) enables turbulent diffusivities to be inferred. Theory indicates that (m) must be a function of the gradient Richardson number. Yet, oceanic studies suggest that a value of around 0.2 for (m) gives turbulent diffusivities that are in good agreement with those inferred from tracer studies. Studies by scientists working with atmospheric radars tend to reinforce these findings but are seldom referenced in oceanographic literature. The goal of this paper is to bring together oceanographic, atmospheric, and laboratory observations related to (m) and to report on the values deduced from in situ data collected in the lower troposphere by unmanned aerial vehicles, equipped with turbulence sensors and flown in the vicinity of the Middle and Upper Atmosphere (MU) radar in Japan. These observations are consistent with past studies in the oceans, in that a value of around 0.16 for (m) yields good agreement between epsilon derived from turbulent temperature fluctuations using this value and epsilon obtained directly from turbulence velocity fluctuations.

Impaired cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics can contribute to reduced exercise performance. We hypothesized that (i) OSA patients show impaired cerebrovascular response both during exercise and in response to hypercapnia together with reduced exercise tolerance and (ii) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment improves these alterations in cerebral oxygenation. Methods: Fifteen OSA patients and 12 healthy matched controls performed a hypercapnic response test and a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after eight weeks of CPAP treatment or control period. Prefrontal cortex and muscle oxygenation were assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during both tests. Results: Cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia was impaired in OSA patients (lower increase in oxyhemoglobin [0.29 +/- 0.19 vs 0.44 +/- 0.14 mu mol mmHg(-1)] and total hemoglobin [0.14 +/- 0.15 vs 0.26 +/- 0.09 mu mol mmHg]) compared to controls. Reduced prefrontal cortex oxygen extraction and total blood volume (ie, lower increase in deoxyhemoglobin [1.76 +/- 1.57 vs 3.43 +/- 2.08 mu mol] and total hemoglobin [5.36 +/- 7.08 vs 8.55 +/- 5.13 mu mol] at exhaustion], respectively) during exercise together with a reduced exercise tolerance (ie, lower peak oxygen consumption) were observed in OSA patients compared to controls. CPAP treatment did not induce any improvement in cerebrovascular response during hypercapnic response test and exercise. Conlusions: This study demonstrates that cerebrovascular response to exercise is altered in OSA and may contribute to exercise intolerance in these patients. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation and exercise tolerance are not significantly improved following eight weeks of CPAP treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The metabolic and phenotypic properties harbored by the Thermotogae species questions the evolutionary events driving the emergence of this early branch of the universal tree of life. Recent reshaping of the Thermotogae taxonomy has led to the description of a new genus, Pseudothermotoga, a sister group of the genus Thermotoga within the order Thermotogales. Comparative genomics of both Pseudothermotoga and Thermotoga spp., including 16S-rRNA-based phylogenetic, pan-genomic analysis as well as signature indel conservation, provided evidence that Thermotoga caldifontis and Thermotoga profunda species should be reclassified within the genus Pseudothermotoga and renamed as Pseudothermotoga caldifontis comb. nov. (type strain = AZM44c09(T)) and Pseudothermotogaprofunda comb. nov. (type strain =AZM34c06(T)), respectively. In addition, based upon whole-genome relatedness indices and DNA-DNA Hybridization results, the reclassification of Pseudothermotoga lettingae and Pseudothermotoga subterranea as latter heterotypic synonyms of Pseudothermotoga elfii is proposed. Finally, potential genetic elements resulting from the distinct evolutionary story of the Thermotoga and Pseudothermotoga clades are discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

The Tidal Garonne River (SW France) has already experienced few episodic hypoxic events. However, predicted future climate and demographic changes suggestthat summer hypoxia could become more severe and even permanent near the city of Bordeaux in the next few decades. A 3D model, which couples hydrodynamic, sediment transport, and biogeochemical processes, is applied to assess the impact offactors submitted to global and regionalclimate changes on oxygenation in the turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) of the Tidal Garonne River during low-discharge periods. The model simulates an intensification of summer hypoxia with an increase in temperature, a decrease in river flow or an increase in the local population, but not with sea level rise, which has a negligible impact on dissolved oxygen. Different scenarios were tested by combining these different factors according to the regional projections for 2050 and 2100. All thesimulations showed a trend toward a spatial and temporal extension of summer hypoxia that needs to be considered by local water authorities to impose management strategies to protect the ecosystem.

In order to do so, we generalize results from [21] on the relation of random Euclidean chains generation and elliptic curve point distribution obtained from those chains. We propose a software implementation of our method on various platforms to illustrate the impact of our approach.

To this end, the MACMod aerosol transport model was implemented in the study area using different sea-state dependent flux formulations. The simulations were compared to a large data set of aerosol size distributions acquired over the last ten years in the study area, yielding the evolution of the sea-spray concentrations with increasing fetch and hence, with the development of the wave field. This allowed for an improvement of the Demoisson et al. (2013) sea-spray source function (S3F) for the Mediterranean. The new formulation extends its validity to shorter fetch and larger radii and turned out to be most suitable for predicting the atmospheric concentrations of sea-spray aerosols in this region.

In addition, two interesting series with rational terms for Euler's constant gamma and the constant In 2 pi are given, and yet another generalization of Euler's constant is proposed and various formulas for the calculation of these constants are obtained. Finally, we mention in the paper that almost all the constants considered in this work admit simple representations via the Ramanujan summation.

That means the pressure, as a function of the density, becomes infinite when the density approaches a finite critical value. Under some structural constraints imposed on the pressure law, we show a weak-strong uniqueness principle in periodic spatial domains. The method is based on a modified relative entropy inequality for the system. The main difficulty is that the pressure potential associated with the internal energy of the system is largely dominated by the pressure itself in the area close to the critical density. As a result, several terms appearing in the relative energy inequality cannot be controlled by the total energy.

Using a small-signal equivalent circuit (macro-model) of the non-inverting amplifier, a theoretical explanation of the closed loop gain is given. The opamp phase margin and its bandwidth have been estimated from the quality factor Q of resonance and using a novel description of the UCVFOA input stage called Operational Transconductance Conveyor (OTC). The OTC description can be seen as an extension of type II second generation current conveyors. Based on the fundamental parameters of the proposed OTC, a theoretical approach given in this paper explains how to evaluate precisely the value of the UCFOA compensation capacitance. PSPICE was used to simulate both the theoretical macro-model and the CMOS configuration from a 0.35 mu m typical BSIM3V3 transistor models.

A monthly monitoring was performed during a two-year cycle (October 2013-December 2015) at two coupled sampling sites, referred to as Little and Large bays, which had different morphometric characteristics and human pressures. Flow cytometry analyses highlighted the fact that pico- and nanophytoplankton were more abundant in the eutrophic Little bay. Furthermore, it evidenced two community structures across the Toulon bays: at times, a co-dominance of picoeukaryotes, nanoeukaryotes, Synechococcus 1-like cells and Prochlorococcus-like cells was found, and at other times, a Synechococcus 1-likedominated community existed. The alternation of one structure or the other can be explained by a combined action of temperature regime, nutrient conditions and degree of contamination. This study showed that pico- and nanophytoplankton dynamics were mainly driven by temperature in both sites, as in other temperate Mediterranean regions. Thus, the community was mainly composed of picoeukaryotes and Prochlorococcus-like cells in the winter (<15 degrees C), while it was dominated by Synechococcus 1-like cells in the summer (>20 degrees C). Additionally, the multiple human stressors in the Little bay seemed to affect the increase in abundance of Synechococcus 1-like cells as they were preferentially observed in the Large bay.

Fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in bioturbated pristine sediments from Caleta Valdes (Patagonia Argentina): An ex situ bioassay								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				162				673	682		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.06.069			OCT 30 2018	2018	Petroleum can pollute pristine shorelines as a consequence of accidental spills or chronic leaks. In this study, the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in soft pristine sediment of Caleta Valdes (Argentina) subject to ex situ simulated oil pollution was assessed. Sedimentary columns were exposed to medium and high concentrations of Escalante Crude Oil (ECO) and incubated in the laboratory during 30 days. Levels of aliphatic hydrocarbons at different depths of the sedimentary column were determined by gas chromatography. Oil penetration was limited to the first three centimetres in both treatments, and under this depth, hydrocarbons were clearly biogenic (terrestrial plants) as in the whole sedimentary column of the control assay. Bioturbation by macrobenthic infauna was strongly impacted by oil pollution which resulted in reduced sediment oxygenation and low burial of petroleum hydrocarbons. This may partly explain the limited hydrocarbon biodegradation observed, as indicated by the relatively high values of the ratios nC17/pristane, nC18/phytane, and total resolved aliphatic hydrocarbons/ unresolved complex mixture. Correspondingly, at the end of the experiment the most probable number of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria reached similar to 10(3 )MPN g(-1)dry weight. These values were lower than those found in chronically polluted coastal sediments, reflecting a low activity level of the oil-degrading community. The results highlight the low attenuation capacities of Caleta Valdes pristine sediments to recover its original characteristics in a short time period if an oil spill occurs. In this work, we present a novel and integrative tool to evaluate the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons and their potential damage on pristine sediments.

Previously, the authors' laboratory has reported the synthesis and the full physico-chemical characterization of homopolymers obtained from 1-ferrocenylmethyl methacrylate (FMMA), 2-(ferrocenylmethoxy)ethyl methacrylate (FMOEMA), and 3-(ferrocenylmethoxy)propyl methacrylate (FMOPMA). Here, the bacterial anti-adhesion activity of these homopolymers (pFMMA, pFMOEMA and pFMOPMA) is reported when stimulated in 96-well microplates containing a printed electrochemical cell in each well. Polymers were deposited on the printed carbon working electrode of each well in two columns each comprising eight wells. Their electrochemical anti-adhesion properties were evaluated by inoculating a marine biofilm forming bacterial strain, Pseudoalteramonas lipolytica, in each well and then applying recurrent scans for 15 h. The results revealed an intrinsic anti-adhesion activity of all the polymers. This activity was amplified by a factor of 10 when potential recurrent scans were applied.		[Edzang, Ronald W.

Only the highest spin irreducible component of torsion gives a proper acceleration with respect to metric NGCs, but at the same time obstructs abreastness of the geodesics. This means that it is necessary to follow the evolution of the drift term in the optical equations, and not just shear, twist and expansion. We show how the optical equations depend on the non-Riemannian components of the curvature, and how they reduce to the metric ones when the highest spin component of torsion vanishes.

Updated Global and Oceanic Mercury Budgets for the United Nations Global Mercury Assessment 2018								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				52	20			11466	11477		10.1021/acs.est.8b01246			OCT 16 2018	2018	In support of international efforts to reduce mercury (Hg) exposure in humans and wildlife, this paper reviews the literature concerning global Hg emissions, cycling and fate, and presents revised global and oceanic Hg budgets for the 2018 United Nations Global Mercury Assessment. We assessed two competing scenarios about the impacts of 16th - late 19th century New World silver (Ag) mining, which may be the largest human source of atmospheric Hg in history. Consideration of Ag ore geochemistry, historical documents on Hg use, and comparison of the scenarios against atmospheric Hg patterns in environmental archives, strongly support a "low mining emission" scenario. Building upon this scenario and other published work, the revised global budget estimates human activities including recycled legacy emissions have increased current atmospheric Hg concentrations by about 450% above natural levels (prevailing before 1450 AD). Current anthropogenic emissions to air are 2.5 +/- 0.S kt/y. The increase in atmospheric Hg concentrations has driven a similar to 300% average increase in deposition, and a 230% increase in surface marine waters. Deeper marine waters show increases of only 12-25%. The overall increase in Hg in surface organic soils (similar to 15%) is small due to the large mass of natural Hg already present from rock weathering, but this figure varies regionally. Specific research recommendations are made to reduce uncertainties, particularly through improved understanding of fundamental processes of the Hg cycle, and continued improvements in emissions inventories from large natural and anthropogenic sources.

This study investigates the role of the organic and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds released by copepods on biogeochemical processes and on the microbial community composition during the OUTPACE cruise (18 February-3 April 2015) at three longduration stations (LD). Two LD stations were located in the Melanesian Archipelago region (MA; LD A and LD B) and one in the South Pacific Gyre (SG; LD C), which represent oligotrophic and ultra-oligotrophic regions respectively. At each station, on-board microcosm experiments were performed with locally sampled organisms, comprising a mix of epipelagic copepods fed with their natural food and then incubated along with wild microbial assemblages. In the presence of copepods, ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen showed a significant increase compared to a control in two situations: in ammonium concentration (rate: 0.29 mu mol L-1 h(-1) after 4 h of incubation) in LD C and in dissolved organic nitrogen concentration (rate: 2.13 mu mol L-1 h(-1) after 0.5 h of incubation) in LD A. In addition, during the three experiments, an enhanced remineralization (ammonification and nitrification) was observed when adding copepods compared to the controls. A shift in the composition of the active bacterial community was observed for the experiments in LD A and LD B, which were mainly characterized by an increase in Alteromonadales and SAR11, respectively, and linked with changes in nutrient concentrations. In the experiment performed in LD C, both groups increased but at different periods of incubation. Alteromonadales increased between 1 and 2 h after the beginning of the experiment, and SAR 11 at the end of incubation. Our results in near in situ conditions show that copepods can be a source of organic and inorganic compounds for bacterial communities, which respond to excretion pulses at different timescales, depending on the initial environmental conditions and on their community composition. These processes can significantly contribute to nutrient recycling and regenerated production in the photic zone of ultra-oligotrophic and oligotrophic oceanic regions.

In this paper, we focus on the topological properties of the single-particle band structure, namely, Chern numbers (lattice with periodic boundary conditions) and edge states (lattice with strip geometry) and their connection to time-reversal symmetry and the sublattice symmetry. While SU(2) spin-orbit couplings always lead to time-reversal symmetric tight-binding models, and thereby to topologically trivial band structures, suitable SU(3) spin-orbit couplings can break time-reversal symmetry and lead to topologically nontrivial bulk band structures and to edge states in the strip geometry. In addition, we show that one can trigger a series of topological transitions (i.e., integer changes of the Chern numbers) that are specific to the geometry of the honeycomb lattice by varying a single parameter in the Hamiltonian.

Four to five KH billows in formation and decay stages were observed for about 20 min at the height of a strong speed shear (> similar to 30 m s(-1) km(-1)), just a few hundred meters above a mid-level cloud base. The turbulent billows had a spacing of about 3.5-4.0 km (3.71 km in average) and an aspect ratio (depth/spacing) of similar to 0.3. The turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate estimated was of the order of 10-50 mWkg(-1), corresponding to moderate turbulence according to ICAO (2010) classification. By chance, an upward-looking fish-eye camera producing pictures once every minute detected smooth protuberances at the cloud base caused by the KH billows so that comparisons of their characteristics could be made for the first time between the radar observations and the pictures. The main characteristics of the KH wave (horizontal wavelength, phase front direction and phase speed) obtained from the analysis of the pictures were fully consistent with those found from radar data. The pictures indicated that the billows were advected by the wind observed at the height of the critical level. They also revealed a very small transverse extent (about twice the horizontal spacing) suggesting that the large-amplitude KH billows were generated by a very localized source. Micro-pulse lidar and Raman-Rayleigh-Mie lidar data also collected during the event permitted us to confirm some of the characteristics of the billows.

This paper presents an overview of various analytical models developed to study the pullout (push-back) behavior of a fiber embedded in a matrix block to characterize the fiber/matrix interfacial adhesion. Two approaches can be distinguished: one based on a maximum stress criterion (shear lag) and the other based on fracture mechanics. This article gives an overview of the analytical models reported in the literature to measure the shear strength and critical fracture energy at the interface, the parameters influencing these properties, the geometry of the model, embedded length of the fiber, fiber diameter and loading conditions (opening width between the knife-edges for example), including components (fiber, matrix, interface), manufacturing route and the resulting defects.

Combining cellular and molecular approaches, we showed that in laboratory cultures, A. formosa microbiome was dynamic and comprised of numerous bacterial species (mainly Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes). Using metagenomics, we explored several metabolic potentials present within the bacterial community. Our analyses suggested that bacteria were heterotrophic although a third of them (Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria) could also be phototrophic. About 60% of the bacteria, phylogenetically diverse, could metabolize glycolate. The capacity to synthesize molecules such as B vitamins appeared unevenly distributed among bacteria. Altogether, our results brought insights into the bacterial diversity found in diatom-bacterial communities and hinted at metabolic interdependencies within the community that could result in diatom-bacterial and bacterial-bacterial interactions. The present work allowed us to explore the functional architecture of the bacterial community associated with A. formosa in culture and is complementary to field studies.

It can be especially useful in the context of photovoltaics, where electrical or structural continuity relations impose connections between quantities, such as current matching between the different subcells of tandem devices. In this work, we apply this method to Intermediate band solar cell, an advanced concept for solar energy conversion in which 2 low-energy photons can promote an electron to the conduction band through a so-called intermediate band. We demonstrate that an intermediate band solar cell under solar spectrum cannot meet voltage preservation and current matching at the same time. By contrast, we show that the implementation of an energy shift (electronic ratchet) in any of the bands lifts one of the constraints set on the system and allows those 2 criteria to be filled simultaneously. Additional insights are provided by the numerical study of the short-circuit current and fill factor of the systems at stake, which show that a system with ratchet benefits from the same current increase as a standard intermediate band solar cell (same short-circuit current), while maintaining I-V properties of a single junction (same open-voltage circuit, same fill factor).

Non-symmetrized quantum noise in a Kondo quantum dot								AIP ADVANCES				8	10					101326	10.1063/1.5043076			OCT 2018	2018	The fluctuations of electrical current provide information on the dynamics of electrons in quantum devices. Understanding the nature of these fluctuations in a quantum dot is thus a crucial step insofar as this system is the elementary brick of quantum circuits. In this context, we develop a theory for calculating the quantum noise at finite frequency in a quantum dot connected to two reservoirs in the presence of interactions and for any symmetry of the couplings to the reservoirs. This theory is developed in the framework of the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green function technique. We establish an analytical expression for the quantum noise in terms of the various transmission amplitudes between the reservoirs and of some effective transmission coefficient which we define. We then study the noise as a function of the dot energy level and the bias voltage. The effects of both Coulomb interactions in the dot and asymmetric couplings with the reservoirs are characterized.

Sunglint images of current gradients at high resolution: Critical angle and directional observing strategy								REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT				216				786	797		10.1016/j.rse.2018.06.011			OCT 2018	2018	High-resolution satellite images of the ocean surface in and around the sunglint often provide unique observations of sub-mesoscale upper ocean surface processes. Local anomalies of wind, waves, currents or surfactants appear on the images as local anomalies of brightness. A quantitative interpretation of those brightness anomalies must relate them to slope properties of the wave field, which are to the lowest order described by the mean square slope (mss). The prevailing paradigm for such interpretation is that of the critical zenith angle. It states that, for subcritical zenith view angle, brightness and mss anomalies have opposite signs, and this defines the so-called inversion region. This prevailing paradigm implicitly builds on the assumption that the mss decomposition between upwind and crosswind components is conserved. The mss anomalies are then isotropic and can be reduced to a scalar (i.e. one-dimensional) quantity. In such a case, one single sunglint image would be sufficient to retrieve the mss anomaly. This isotropic case likely applies for surface wave changes induced by varying wind speed or by surfactants. Yet, satellite and airborne observations at multiple view angles recently revealed anisotropic mss anomalies, e.g. with mss increase in the upwind direction and decrease in the crosswind direction. This anisotropic behavior likely characterizes wave modulations by anisotropic surface current gradients. This paper details the expected properties of such anisotropic mss modulations. It is shown that: 1) The classical concept of critical angle does not systematically hold, neither for frontal current shear nor for internal wave divergence. 2) At least two sunglint images at different zenith and azimuth angles are needed to retrieve the mss anomalies, and a single observation is not sufficient. 3) A satellite with radiometers looking at multiple zenith angles is capable of providing a geometry favorable to retrieve mss anomalies. An illustration is discussed with internal waves observed by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), where the upwind and crosswind components of the retrieved mss anomalies are anisotropic. Those results provide guidelines to interpret available observations and to help refine strategy for future satellite missions.

We propose new different iterative optimization schemes based on Conjugate Gradient, Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient, Levenberg-Marquardt and Quasi-Newton methods. We perform also a study to determine which of these algorithms offer the best compromise between efficiency and convergence speed in the studied context. To be able to derive all these algorithms, a preconditioner has to be computed which requires either the calculation of the complex Hessian matrices or the use of an approximation to these Hessian matrices. Furthermore, the optimal stepsize is also computed algebraically to speed up the convergence of these algorithms. Computer simulations are provided in order to illustrate the behavior of the different algorithms in various contexts: when exactly block-diagonal matrices are considered but also when these matrices are progressively perturbed by an additive Gaussian noise. Finally, it is shown that these algorithms enable solving the blind separation of the convolutive mixtures of sources problem.

Use of palmitoleic acid and its oxidation products for monitoring the degradation of ice algae in Arctic waters and bottom sediments								ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY				124				88	102		10.1016/j.orggeochem.2018.06.002			OCT 2018	2018	Degradation of palmitoleic acid (C-16:1 omega 7), the main fatty acid component of sea ice-associated (sympagic) diatoms, was monitored in Arctic sea ice at the beginning of ice melting and in the underlying sinking particles and superficial bottom sediments. In sea ice, degradation of sympagic algae involved biotic oxidation induced by 10S-DOX-like lipoxygenase of unknown salinity-stressed attached bacteria, while photo-and autoxidation were limited. In the water column, strong hydratase and Z/E isomerase activity were observed. Hydration of unsaturated fatty acids seems to be a detoxification strategy, which is essential for bacterial survival when associated with free fatty acid-rich environments such as ice algae. In contrast, Z/E isomerisation of palmitoleic acid was attributed to the release of Fe2+ ions during radical-induced damage of the active site of the bacterial 10S-DOX-like lipoxygenase and Z/E isomerases. Due to the poor physiological state of their attached bacteria resulting from salinity stress in brine channels or toxicity of free ice algae fatty acids, sympagic algae appeared to be only very weakly biotically degraded within the water column. In bottom sediments, free radicals resulting from 10S-DOX-like lipoxygenase activity induced a strong autoxidation of the ice algal material. The presence in bottom sediments of a significant proportion of oxidation products resulting from 10S-DOX-like lipoxygenase activity attested to the strong contribution of sea ice-derived OM released during the early stages of ice melt prior to deposition in the sediments. However, on the basis of the highest fatty acid photooxidation state observed in these sediments, an additional contribution of highly photooxidized material (ice algal material released at the end of ice melting or open water phytoplankton) seems likely. The degradation of hydroperoxides, resulting from biotic and abiotic degradation of palmitoleic acid, appeared to involve: (i) homolytic cleavage of the peroxyl group affording the corresponding hydroxy-and oxoacids, (ii) reduction to the corresponding hydroxyacids by peroxygenases, (iii) heterolytic proton-catalysed cleavage and (iv) conversion to allylic 1,4-diols by diol synthases and hydroperoxide isomerases.

Seasonal Meandering of the Polar Front Upstream of the Kerguelen Plateau								GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS				45	18			9774	9781		10.1029/2018GL079614			SEP 28 2018	2018	The location of the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) is mapped in the Southern Indian Ocean by decomposing the shape of temperature and salinity profiles into vertical modes using a functional Principal Component Analysis. We define the PF as the northernmost minimum of temperature at the subsurface and represent it as a linear combination of the first three modes. This method is applied on an ocean reanalysis data set and on in situ observations, revealing a seasonal variability of the PF latitudinal position that is most pronounced between the Conrad Rise and the Kerguelen Plateau. This shift coincides with variations in the transport across the Northern Kerguelen Plateau. We suggest that seasonal changes of the upper stratification may drive the observed variability of the PF, with potentially large implications for the pathways and residence time of water masses over the plateau and the phytoplankton bloom extending southeast of the Kerguelen Islands. Plain Language Summary The Antarctic Polar Front (PF) is a water mass boundary that flows around Antarctica between approximately 48 degrees S and 56 degrees S in the Southern Indian Ocean. The position of the PF in space and time is important to understand the oceanic circulation, the heat and salt exchanges, and also marine ecosystems. In the Indian sector the PF has to cross the Kerguelen Plateau, a major bottom topography feature. The present study develops and then applies a novel method for mapping the PF taking into account the whole hydrographic structure in the upper 300 m of the ocean. We are able to map the PF position and find that it presents large seasonal variations that are more intense just west of the Kerguelen Plateau. Between the Conrad Rise and the Kerguelen Plateau, the PF is essentially zonally orientated in September and found farther south by up to 4 degrees latitude in March. Shifts in the PF position are shown to correlate with a seasonal variation in volume transport between Kerguelen and Heard Islands. We discuss how these seasonal variations in circulation pathways could have an impact on the local marine ecosystems.

We discuss this concept in connection with the unitary evolution of discrete-time quantum walks in one and two spatial dimensions, when they include the interaction with synthetic, external electromagnetic fields. One introduces this interaction as additional phases that play the role of gauge fields. Here, we present a way to incorporate those phases, which differs from previous works. Our proposal allows the discrete derivatives, that appear under a gauge transformation, to treat time and space on the same footing, in a way which is similar to standard lattice gauge theories. By considering two steps of the evolution, we define a density current which is gauge invariant and conserved. In the continuum limit, the dynamics of the particle, under a suitable choice of the parameters, becomes the Dirac equation and the conserved current satisfies the corresponding conservation equation.

It involves the first Si stock measurements in this understudied region, encompassing various oceanic systems from New Caledonia to the Chilean upwelling between 8 and 34 degrees S. Some of the lowest levels of biogenic silica standing stocks ever measured were found in this area, notably in the southern Pacific gyre, where Chlorophyll a concentrations are the most depleted worldwide. Integrated biogenic silica stocks are as low as 1.08 +/- 0.95 mmol m(-2) and are the lowest stocks measured in the South Pacific. Size-fractionated biogenic silica concentrations revealed a non-negligible contribution of the pico-sized fraction (<2-3 mu m) to biogenic silica standing stocks, representing 26% +/- 12% of total biogenic silica during the OUTPACE cruise and 11% +/- 9% during the BIOSOPE cruise. These results indicate significant accumulation in this size class, which was undocumented for 2005, but has since then been related to Si uptake by Synechococcus cells. Si uptake measurements carried out during BIOSOPE confirmed biological Si uptake by this size fraction. We further present diatoms community structure associated with the stock measurements for a global overview of the Si cycle in the tropical South Pacific.

J	Gruet, Mathieu								Fatigue in Chronic Respiratory Diseases: Theoretical Framework and Implications For Real-Life Performance and Rehabilitation								FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY				9						1285	10.3389/fphys.2018.01285			SEP 19 2018	2018	Fatigue is a primary disabling symptom in chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) with major clinical implications. However, fatigue is not yet sufficiently explored and is still poorly understood in CRD, making this symptom underdiagnosed and undertreated in these populations. Fatigue is a dynamic phenomenon, particularly in such evolving diseases punctuated by acute events which can, alone or in combination, modulate the degree of fatigue experienced by the patients. This review supports a comprehensive inter-disciplinary approach of CRD-related fatigue and emphasizes the need to consider both its performance and perceived components. Most studies in CRD evaluated perceived fatigue as a trait characteristic using multidimensional scales, providing precious information about its prevalence and clinical impact. However, these scales are not adapted to understand the complex dynamics of fatigue in real-life settings and should be augmented with ecological assessment of fatigue. The state level of fatigue must also be considered during physical tasks as severe fatigue can emerge rapidly during exercise. CRD patients exhibit alterations in both peripheral and central nervous systems and these abnormalities can be exacerbated during exercise. Laboratory tests are necessary to provide mechanistic insights into how and why fatigue develops during exercise in CRD. A better knowledge of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying perceived and performance fatigability and their influence on real-life performance will enable the development of new individualized countermeasures. This review aims first to shed light on the terminology of fatigue and then critically considers the contemporary models of fatigue and their relevance in the particular context of CRD. This article then briefly reports the prevalence and clinical consequences of fatigue in CRD and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of various fatigue scales. This review also provides several arguments to select the ideal test of performance fatigability in CRD and to translate the mechanistic laboratory findings into the clinical practice and real-world performance. Finally, this article discusses the dose-response relationship to training and the feasibility and validity of using the fatigue produced during exercise training sessions in CRD to optimize exercise training efficiency. Methodological concerns, examples of applications in selected diseases and avenues for future research are also provided.

EPJ DATA SCIENCE				7						34	10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0161-9			SEP 15 2018	2018	Comprehensive and quantitative investigations of social theories and phenomena increasingly benefit from the vast breadth of data describing human social relations that is now available within the realm of computational social science. Such data are, however, typically proxies for one of the many interaction layers composing social networks, which can be defined in many ways and are composed of communication of various types (e.g., phone calls, face-to-face communication, etc.). As a result, many studies focus on one single layer, corresponding to the data at hand. Several studies have however shown that these layers are not interchangeable, despite the presence of a certain level of correlation between them. Here, we investigate whether different layers of interactions among individuals lead to similar conclusions with respect to the presence of homophily patterns in a population-homophily represents one of the widest studied phenomenon in social networks. To this aim, we consider a data set describing interactions and links of various nature in a population of Asian students with diverse nationalities, first language and gender. We study homophily patterns, as well as their temporal evolution in each layer of the social network. To facilitate our analysis, we put forward a general method to assess whether the homophily patterns observed in one layer inform us about patterns in another layer. For instance, our study reveals that three network layers-cell phone communications, questionnaires about friendship, and trust relations-lead to similar and consistent results despite some minor discrepancies. The homophily patterns of the co-presence network layer, however, does not yield any meaningful information about other network layers.		[Manivannan, Ajaykumar; Yow, W.

Performing quasi-classical calculations on a two-dimensional system, with an external magnetic flux to generate a DC current, we show that the current can trigger a transition to a state with a domain wall between regions of different chiralities. The system shows an hysteretic behavior, as different domain wall configurations are possible for a given current. This domain wall creation mechanism can give new insights on recent experiments observing anomalous current variations in Sr2RuO4 junctions.

We present here an assessment of the atmospheric occurrence and seasonality of soil/snow-air partitioning and exchange of PCBs, PAHs, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) in the arctic city Tromso, northern Norway. The fugacities of the organic pollutants in soils and snow were determined using a soil fugacity sampler by equilibrating the air concentrations with those in the surface soil/snow. The concentrations in soils did not show a significant seasonality. Conversely, the ambient air concentrations and the soil (or snow) fugacity showed a clear seasonality for PCBs, HCH, HCB and some PAHs, related to temperature. Fugacities in soil/snow were correlated with those in the ambient gas phase, suggesting a close seasonal air-soil/snow coupling. Generally, there was a net deposition or close to equilibrium conditions during the winter, which contrasts with the net volatilization observed during the warmer periods. The chemicals with lower octanol-air partition coefficients showed a larger tendency for being volatilized and thus remobilized from this coastal arctic environment. Conversely, the more hydrophobic compounds were close to air-soil/snow equilibrium or showed a net deposition. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Kaolinite crystallinity indices were evaluated in the context of pedogenetic processes associated with a representative Amazonian Ferralsol-Podzol soil system. This soil system, which is comprised of various types of kaolinitic materials and has a soil dynamics characterized by the progressive replacement of Ferralsols by Podzols, has been evaluated by Hinckley (HI), Aparicio-Galan-Ferrell (AGFI), Lietard (R2), and Amigo (A(001)) "crystallinity indices" and the "expert system" of Plancon and Zacharie (PZ). The results indicate that the complexity of the kaolinite population, which is due to pedogenetic processes, makes it difficult to interpret the usual kaolinite crystallinity indices. In areas where kaolinites are formed under low aggressive conditions (higher pH and lower dissolved organic carbon, DOC) and in equilibrium with the soil solutions, low-defect phase becomes dominant and there is a good consistency between the "crystallinities" provided by each index. However, in areas where kaolinites are formed under highly aggressive conditions (lower pH and higher DOC), the proportion of low-defect phase decreases. This induces changes in the values of the indices, which do not have the same weight from one index to another.

Trunk and the right-upper limb kinematics data were assessed with an optoeletronic device (Qualisys) and the force applied on the handrim was recorded with an instrumented wheel (SMARTWheel (R)). Data acquisitions were performed at 60/80/10/120/140% of the freely chosen frequency at submaximal and maximal conditions. The final database consisted of d = 5708 push phases. The input data were the trunk and right upper-limb kinematics (joint angle, angular velocity and acceleration) and anthropometric data (height, weight, segment length) and the output data were the applied forces orientation and amplitude. A ratio of 70/15/15 was used to train, validate and test the RNN (d(train) = 3996, d(validation) = 856 and d(test) = 856). The angle and amplitude errors between the measured and predicted force was assessed from d(test). Results showed that for most of the push phase (-70%), the force direction prediction errors were less than 12. The mean absolute amplitude errors were less than 8 N and the mean absolute amplitude percentage errors were less than 20% for most of the push phase (-80%). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

If a macromolecule is modeled as an open system-that is, it is subjected to an external energy supply and is in contact with a thermal bath to dissipate the excess energy-the internal nonlinear couplings among the normal modes make the system undergo a nonequilibrium phase transition when the energy input rate exceeds a threshold value. This transition takes place between a state where the energy is incoherently distributed among the normal modes and a state where the input energy is channeled into the lowest-frequency mode entailing a coherent oscillation of the entire molecule. The model put forward in the present work is derived as the classical counterpart of a quantum model proposed a long time ago by Frohlich in an attempt to explain the huge speed of enzymatic reactions. We show that such a phenomenon is actually possible. Two different and complementary THz near-field spectroscopic techniques-a plasmonic rectenna and a microwire near-field probe-have been used in two different labs to eliminate artifacts. By considering an aqueous solution of a model protein, the bovine serum albumin, we find that this protein displays a remarkable absorption feature around 0.314 THz, when driven in a stationary out-of-thermal equilibrium state by means of optical pumping. The experimental outcomes are in very good qualitative agreement with the theory developed in the first part of the paper and in excellent quantitative agreement with the theoretical result, allowing us to identify the observed spectral feature with a collective oscillation of the entire molecule.

Trace metal concentrations and Pb isotopic ratios in atmospheric particulate matter <10m (PM10) were used to track the origins and the transport pathways of atmospheric pollutants. This approach was used for fortnightly PM10 collections over a complete annual cycle in Haiphong, northern Vietnam. Distinct seasonal patterns were observed for the trace metal concentration in PM10, with a maximum during the Northeast (NE) monsoon and a minimum during the Southeast (SE) monsoon. Some elements (As, Cd, Mn) were found in excess according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Coal combustion was highlighted with enrichment factors of As, Cd, Se, and Sb, but these inputs were outdistanced by other anthropogenic activities. V/Ni and Cu/Sb ratios were found to be markers of oil combustion, while Pb/Cd and Zn/Pb ratios were found to be markers of industrial activities. Pb isotopic composition in PM10 revealed an important contribution of soil dusts (45-60%). In PM10, the Pb fraction due to oil combustion was correlated with dominant airflow pathways (31% during the north-easterlies and 20% during the south-easterlies), and the Pb fraction resulting from industrial emissions was stable (around 28%) throughout the year. During the SE monsoon, Pb inputs were mainly attributed to resuspension of local soil dusts (about 90%), and during the NE monsoon, the increase of Pb inPM(10) was due to the mixing of local and regional inputs.

Additionally, we assessed the effects of spatial scale on the predictive capabilities of environmental variables. LocationTime periodGlobal oceans. 2000 to 2015. Major taxa studiedMethodsTunas: Thunnus albacares, Thunnus obesus, Thunnus alalunga. We undertook a global compilation and meta-analysis of the bulk nitrogen stable isotope ratios (N-15 values) of three tuna species (n=4,281). After adjusting for regional variations in baseline N-15 values using a global ocean biogeochemistry model, generalized additive mixed models were employed to infer global-scale oceanographic controls of trophic structure, using cosmopolitan tuna species as a model. ResultsMain conclusionsFor the three tuna species, variation in trophic position estimated using bulk N-15 values was largely explained by geographical location and the corresponding oxygen minimum layer depth. Tuna trophic positions declined in areas with reduced oxygen at depth. Food-chain length, as captured by maximum trophic position, was longer in areas of the western Pacific Ocean and shorter in the northern Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans. Trophic adaptability of the tuna predators, as indicated by intraspecific variability, was highest in the western and central Pacific Ocean and lowest in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Our analysis demonstrated that while tunas share similar functional trophic roles, deeper-foraging tuna species had higher trophic positions globally. The predictive capacity of environmental variables decreased at finer (regional) spatial scales. Our work suggests that habitat compression resulting from the predicted global expansion of oxygen minimum zones with ocean warming will impact the trophic structure of marine food webs and the corresponding foraging habits of marine predators. Spatial scale analyses highlighted the importance of representing differences in regional ecological dynamics in global-scale trophic and ecosystem models.

Although research has taken steps to resolve these issues, variability combined with high programming currents remains an important characteristic for RRAMs. In a conventional write scheme with fixed duration and amplitude, the programming current is not controlled, which degrades the cell performance (power consumption and variability) due to over-programming. In this paper, a self-adaptive write driver is proposed to control the write current. A feedback mechanism based on current comparison is used to switch off the write stimulus as soon as the preferred write current is reached. Compared to conventional write schemes, in the proposed write-assist circuit, the write energy per bit is reduced by 27% and the standard deviation of post-FORMING distributions is reduced by 57%.

A recently proposed neural network paradigm, namely Echo State Network (ESN) is utilized here to derive a degradation model, taking into account its high efficiency in modeling nonlinear dynamical systems. Meanwhile, a particle filter approach is developed to update the initially trained ESN model and to quantify the uncertainty of the RUL prediction online.

These viruses are ubiquitous in the sea and have impact on marine microbial community structure and dynamics through their lytic infection cycle. However, their diversity and biogeography have been poorly characterized due to the scarce detection of Megaviridae sequences in metagenomes, as well as the limitation of reference sequences used to design specific primers for this viral group. Here, we propose a set of 82 degenerated primers (referred to as MEGAPRIMER), targeting DNA polymerase genes (polBs) of Megaviridae. MEGAPRIMER was designed based on 921 Megaviridae polBs from sequenced genomes and metagenomes. By applying this primer set to environmental DNA meta-barcoding of a coastal seawater sample, we report 5595 non-singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Megaviridae at 97% nucleotide sequence identity. The majority of the OTUs were found to form diverse clades, which were phylogenetically distantly related to known viruses such as Mimivirus. The Megaviridae OTUs detected in this study outnumber the giant virus OTUs identified in previous individual studies by more than an order of magnitude. Hence, MEGAPRIMER represents a useful tool to study the diversity of Megaviridae at the population level in natural environments.

An efficient framework, called completed and statistical adaptive patterns on three orthogonal planes (CSAP-TOP), for representation of dynamic textures and scenes is addressed in this work. It utilizes adaptive thresholding applied in a completed schema on high-order moment images of three orthogonal planes. Some beneficial properties from its complementary features are inherited: taking into account information from local variations of magnitudes, robustness against noise and near-uniform regions, exploiting more useful and stable textural information at local and regional scales. In addition, we also consider the impact of high-order filtered images and adaptive thresholding in volume statistical adaptive patterns (VSAP) to investigate their influence and efficiency on describing DT and scene sequences. Evaluations of recognition on different datasets of dynamic textures and scenes (UCLA, DynTex, YUPENN, YUP ++) show that our proposal, without utilizing sophisticated learning techniques, significantly outperforms recent results in the state-of-the-art.

Through atomic force microscopy measurements, the surface morphology evolution of (100)-oriented MgO as a function of the annealing conditions is investigated. In particular, we discuss the effect of temperature, time and ambient atmosphere on the evolution of the MgO surface arrangement. At annealing temperature of 1000 degrees C for 40 min, MgO surface morphology displays an atomically flat, single terminated surface with (100)-oriented, sharp terraces and equidistant steps equal to half of the MgO lattice parameter. Longer annealing leads to the formation of bunched terraces with large step heights of 1-5nm. The optimized recipe developed here efficiently removes surface adsorbates, namely hydroxyl and carbonate groups and restores the terraces on the surface. (C) 2018 Author(s).

Study of the Response of a New Compact Calorimetric Cell for Nuclear Heating Rate Measurements								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE				65	9			2461	2470		10.1109/TNS.2018.2827084			SEP 2018	2018	This paper presents experimental and theoretical studies of a new compact calorimetric cell under laboratory conditions. Producing a reduced-size calorimetric cell, intended to be used to quantify the nuclear heating rate inside material testing reactors by differential calorimetry, is a major challenge and offers new complementary measurement prospects. The new compact design, called CALOrimeter with radial thermal transfers for nuclear REactors, is obtained with a special geometry favoring heat transfers in the radial direction in order to decrease the height of the sensor. Results obtained during a crucial preliminary step corresponding to out-of-pile calibration without nuclear rays are presented and compared with those of three different configurations. The influence of different parameters, such as a specific area of the cell structure, fluid temperature and velocity, and the nature of the material of the cell structure, is shown and analyzed with a 1-D thermal model coupling conductive and radiative thermal exchanges. Comparisons of different configurations and conditions lead to a discussion of the advantages of this new compact design.

A three-dimensional phase-field code is designed to reproduce the same conditions as the ones imposed in the experiments. Our numerical results allow us to propose scaling laws that govern the dynamics of dendritic primary arms, with the solute composition and the average distance between two nuclei as physical parameters. These laws are used to extrapolate our numerical results to the experimental situation where phase-field simulations are beyond reach. Good quantitative agreement is found between the predicted behavior and the experimental observations, which validates the scaling laws obtained.

In this paper, we propose an ordinal approach to using data on assets when estimating the wealth of a household (or individual). Using Correspondence Analysis, we derive a ranking of the correlations between the various assets and the first factor, a latent variable assumed to represent the standard of living. We then use this correlation ranking of the assets to derive indices of ordinal inequality that have been recently proposed in the literature. We also use the information on the proportion of individuals holding each type of assets to derive again ordinal measures of inequality in asset ownership. Our empirical analysis, based on data covering the various states of Mexico in 2000 and 2010, shows that the correlation between measures of ordinal inequality in asset ownership derived from correspondence analysis and traditional Gini indices of household income is high, and even higher than that between these Gini indices and ordinal inequality indices based on the percentage ownership of the different assets.

Thirty-five adults with CF (FEV1 = 58 +/- 23%) performed a CPET on cycle ergometer with gas exchange measurements. Leg, chest and overall RPE were collected every minute throughout the test. Linear regressions between O-2 and RPE ae<currency> 15 were extrapolated to maximal theoretical RPE (i.e. RPE18 and RPE19) to predict O-2peak. Agreements between measured and all predicted O-2peak were tested using Bland-Altman Plots, for the whole group and for subjects presenting significant exercise intolerance (n = 24). Leg, chest and overall RPE increased similarly with exercise intensity. No differences were found between predicted O-2peak and measured O-2peak with RPE18 as maximal RPE, for both overall and differentiated RPE (P range 0.94-0.98). Ranges for Pearson correlations and limits of agreements were 0.88-0.91 and 380-461 mL min(-1) for the whole group and 0.92-0.94 and 269-365 mL min(-1) for subjects with significant exercise intolerance. The greatest association and narrowest limits of agreements were obtained from chest RPE scores. Submaximal RPE scores obtained during CPET can provide acceptable estimate of O-2peak in adults with CF, particularly in those having significant exercise intolerance. Future studies should assess whether the prediction can be improved, particularly by encouraging the regular use of RPE scales during physical activities/exercise rehabilitations sessions.

This study aimed to investigate the diversity and abundance of microbial communities inhabiting Chott El Jerid during wet season (when it was flooded), using molecular methods [Illumina Miseq sequencing, DGGE and qPCR (qPCR)]. 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed that bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria (especially Ralstonia species), followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The results obtained using prokaryotic universal primers showed low relative abundance of Archaea dominated by few OTUs related to Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomassiliicoccaceae families and the presence of sulfate-reducing Archaea affiliated with Archaeoglobus. However, the results obtained using Archaea-specific primers showed that archaeal community was mainly composed of aerobic Halobacteria (especially Halorubrum species) and anaerobic members of Methanomicrobia. These results also provided evidence for the presence of members of the genus Halohasta in this environment. qPCR results revealed that Archaea were more abundant in studied samples than Bacteria. The sulfate-reducing Bacteria were also found abundant (one-third of the bacterial community) and outnumbered methanogens, suggesting their potential important role in this sulfate-rich and hypersaline ecosystem.

Concentrations of PAHs, AHs, PCBs and OCPs ranged 0.5-17.8 ng m(-3), 6.7-126.5 ng m(-3), 0.3-11 pg m(-3) and 0.2-3.6 pg m(-3), respectively, with higher levels of all contaminants measured in winter. A combined analysis revealed AHs originating from both biogenic and petrogenic sources, while diesel vehicle emissions were identified as dominant sources for PAHs. PCB potential sources included electronic, iron, cement, lubricant factories located within or outside Bizerte city. The dominant OCP congeners were p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, reflecting a current or past use in agriculture. Health risk assessment showed that the lifetime excess cancer risk from exposure to airborne BaP was negligible in Bizerte, except in winter, where a potential risk to the local population may occur.

J	Lefebvre, Jean-Pierre; Mari, Xavier; Thuoc Van Chu								A laboratory study on the generation of estuarine negatively, neutrally and positively buoyant bio-mediated flocs								ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				208				180	190		10.1016/j.ecss.2018.05.005			AUG 31 2018	2018	In estuaries and coastal areas, the mixing of inorganic and organic sediments results in the production of biomediated flocs. Their densities depend on the ratio between the light organic fraction and the mineral ballast. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are ubiquitous in estuarine and marine environments. Because of their positive buoyancy, they form biofilms at the water surface. In order to investigate how the bio-mediated flocculation involving TEP impacts the sedimentation processes in the near surface layer of estuaries, we determined at the laboratory, the ascending/descending velocity of the mineral particles and their flocs size distributions (FSDs) of sediments sampled from the Cam River estuary (Vietnam), for concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 mg L-1, for two levels of turbulence representative to the slack water and mid ebb conditions of this estuary and for various TEP concentration and stickiness. The obtained results showed that the sediment velocity varied over two orders of magnitude depending of the conditions of the experiment. Ascending velocities were mostly measured for mid ebb conditions. The generated positively buoyant bio-mediated flocs were formed by microflocs coated by a TEP matrix. For the slack water conditions, FSDs were highly dependent of the TEP concentration and stickiness. Positively buoyant bio-mediated flocs were generated for specific concentrations and stickiness of TEP only. The corresponding FSDs were consistent with positively buoyant macroflocs, with TEP located mostly inside the flocs.

We performed measurements of backscattering and absorption coefficients, irradiance, and radiance in the euphotic zone with a Satlantic MicroPro free-fall profiler and took Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UPV5) pictures for counting the largest Trichodesmium spp. colonies. Pigment concentrations were determined by fluorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography and picoplankton abundance by flow cytometry. Trichome concentration was estimated from pigment algorithms and validated by surface visual counts. The abundance of large colonies counted by the UVP5 (maximum 7093 colonies m(-3)) was well correlated to the trichome concentrations (maximum 2093 trichomes L-1) with an aggregation factor of 600. In the Melanesian archipelago, a maximum of 4715 trichomes L-1 was enumerated in pump samples (3.2 m) at 20 degrees S, 167 30 degrees E. High Trichodesmium abundance was always associated with absorption peaks of mycosporine-like amino acids (330, 360 nm) and high particulate backscattering, but not with high Chl a fluorescence or blue particulate absorption (440 nm). Along the west-to-east transect, Trichodesmium together with Prochlorococcus represented the major part of total chlorophyll concentration; the contribution of other groups were relatively small or negligible. The Trichodesmium contribution to total chlorophyll concentration was the highest in the Melanesian archipelago around New Caledonia and Vanuatu (60 %), progressively decreased to the vicinity of the islands of Fiji (30 %), and reached a minimum in the South Pacific Gyre where Prochlorococcus dominated chlorophyll concentration. The contribution of Trichodesmium to zeaxanthin was respectively 50, 40 and 20% for these regions. During the OUTPACE cruise, the relationship between normalized water-leaving radiance (nL(w)) in the ultraviolet and visible and chlorophyll concentration was similar to that found during the BIOSOPE cruise in the eastern tropical Pacific. Principal component analysis (PCA) of OUTPACE data showed that nL(w) at 305, 325, 340, 380, 412 and 440 nm was strongly correlated to chlorophyll and zeaxanthin, while nL(w) at 490 and 565 nm exhibited lower correlations. These results, as well as differences in the PCA of BIOSOPE data, indicated that nL(w) variability in the greenish blue and yellowish green during OUTPACE was influenced by other variables associated with Trichodesmium presence, such as backscattering coefficient, phycoerythrin fluorescence and/or zeaxanthin absorption, suggesting that Trichodesmium detection should involve examination of nLw in this spectral domain.

Ecosystems are made of various dynamic microhabitats where microbial communities interact with each other establishing metabolically interdependent relationships. Very limited information is available on multispecies biofilms and their microhabitats related to natural environments. The objective of this study is to understand how marine bacteria isolated from biofilms in the Mediterranean Sea interact and compete with each other when cultivated in multispecies biofilms. Four strains (Persicivirga mediterranea TC4, Polaribacter sp. TC5, Shewanella sp. TC10 and TC11) with different phenotypical traits and abilities to form a biofilm have been selected from a previous study. Here, the results show that these strains displayed a different capacity to form a biofilm in static versus dynamic conditions where one strain, TC11 , was highly susceptible to the flux. These bacteria appeared to be specialized in the secretion of one or two exopolymers. Only TC5 seemed to secrete inhibitory molecule(s) in its supernatant, with a significant effect on TC10. Most of the strains negatively impacted each other, except TC4 and TC10, which presented a synergetic effect in the two and three species biofilms. Interestingly, these two strains produced a newly secreted compound when grown in dual-species versus mono-species biofilms. TC5, which induced a strong inhibition on two of its partners in dual-species biofilms, outfitted the other bacteria in a four-species biofilm. Therefore, understanding how bacteria respond to interspecific interactions should help comprehending the dynamics of bacterial populations in their ecological niches.

This paper reports this new dataset and derived properties: pH on the total scale (pH(T)) and the CaCO3 saturation state with respect to aragonite (Omega(ara)). We also estimate anthropogenic carbon (C-ANT) distribution in the water column using the TrOCA method (Tracer combining Oxygen, inorganic Carbon and total Alkalinity) Along the OUTPACE transect a deeper penetration of C-ANT in the intermediate waters was observed in the MA, whereas highest C-ANT concentrations were detected in the subsurface waters of the WGY. By combining our OUTPACE dataset with data available in GLODAPv2 (1974-2009), temporal changes in oceanic inorganic carbon were evaluated. An increase of 1.3 to 1.6 mu mol kg(-1) a(-1) for total inorganic carbon in the upper thermocline waters is estimated, whereas C-ANT increases by 1.1 to 1.2 mu mol kg(-1) a(-1). In the MA intermediate waters (27 kg m(-3) < sigma(theta) < 27.2 kg m(-3)) an increase of 0.4 mu mol kg(-1) a(-1) C-ANT is detected. Our results suggest a clear progression of ocean acidification in the western tropical South Pacific with a decrease in the oceanic pHT of up to -0.0027 a(-1) and a shoaling of the saturation depth for aragonite of up to 200 m since the pre-industrial period.

J	Arrighi, Pablo; Di Molfetta, Giuseppe; Facchini, Stefano								Quantum walking in curved spacetime: discrete metric								QUANTUM				2										AUG 22 2018	2018	A discrete-time quantum walk (QW) is essentially a unitary operator driving the evolution of a single particle on the lattice. Some QWs have familiar physics PDEs as their continuum limit. Some slight generalization of them (allowing for prior encoding and larger neighbourhoods) even have the curved spacetime Dirac equation, as their continuum limit. In the (1 + 1)-dimensional massless case, this equation decouples as scalar transport equations with tunable speeds. We characterise and construct all those QWs that lead to scalar transport with tunable speeds. The local coin operator dictates that speed; we provide concrete techniques to tune the speed of propagation, by making use only of a finite number of coin operators-differently from previous models, in which the speed of propagation depends upon a continuous parameter of the quantum coin. The interest of such a discretization is twofold : to allow for easier experimental implementations on the one hand, and to evaluate ways of quantizing the metric field, on the other.

Total and partial oxidation reactions were observed for both samples in the temperature range 600-750 degrees C under CH4/dry air flux. At high CH4 concentration and low temperature with the ternary tungstate as catalyst, the partial oxidation, leading to CO/H-2, prevails. This indicates the potentiality of the new strontium cerium tungstate scheelite compound for the catalysis of CH4. Sr0.5Ce0.35WO4 and SrWO4 exhibit different conduction mechanisms. Conduction in the binary compound is related to the overlapping large polaron tunneling model, whereas conduction in the ternary one is due to a correlated barrier hopping phenomenon. The activation energies, in the low temperature range where the partial oxidation occurs, are significantly lower for the ternary compound than for the binary one. These electrical tendencies favor both partial and total oxidation of methane. The correlated barrier hopping conduction in the ternary compound leads to a better partial oxidation rate than conduction through large polaron tunneling. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here we describe the biodiversity and community structure of demersal fish assemblages and their habitat along the northeast Brazilian coast by combining bottom trawl data and underwater footage. Species composition was estimated by number and weight, while patterns of dominance were obtained based on frequency of occurrence and relative abundance. A total of 7235 individuals (830 kg), distributed in 24 orders, 49 families and 120 species were collected. Community structure was investigated through clustering analysis and by a non-metric multidimensional scaling technique. Finally, diversity was assessed based on six indices. Four major assemblages were identified, mainly associated with habitat type and depth range. The higher values of richness were found in sand substrate with rocks, coralline formations and sponges (SWCR) habitats, while higher values of diversity were found in habitats located on shallow waters (10-30 m). Further, assemblages associated with sponge-reef formations presented the highest values of richness and diversity. In management strategies of conservation, we thus recommend giving special attention on SWCR habitats, mainly those located on depths between 30 and 60 m. This can be achieved by an offshore expansion of existing MPAs and/or by the creation of new MPAs encompassing those environments.

Numerical models using ABAQUS (TM) Tm are developed in order to predict the mechanical behavior of a unidirectional composite (E-glass fibers/epoxy) under monotonic transverse traction. A Representative Volume Element description with a random distribution of the fibers is used. Linear elastic constitutive materials and Kinematic Uniform Boundary Conditions are considered. A numerical/experimental comparison is made in order to validate the model. The thickness and the modulus of the interphase have been determined by experimental measurements based on Atomic Force Microscopy and introduced in the numerical simulation, the effect of these properties as well as the effect of the interphase Poisson's ratio, on the effective elastic properties of the composite is discussed. The obtained results are in good agreement with the experimental values previously measured by tensile test on macroscopic samples. The fact of considering the interphase improves the accuracy of the prediction of the composite's mechanical elastic behavior.

The bis-indanedione molecule reacted with itself on silver surfaces in different ways, through a Knoevenagel reaction or an oxidative coupling, leading to the formation of a variety of new molecular compounds and covalently-linked 1D or 2D networks. Noteworthy, original reaction products were obtained that cannot be synthesized in traditional solvent-based chemistry. The lowest activation temperature for the homo-coupling reactions was found on the Ag(111) surface. The Ag(110) was highly selective in terms of coupling reaction type, while on Ag(100) the temperature could finely control the selectivity. The on-surface synthesis approach is shown here to be particularly efficient to produce original compounds in mild conditions, using activation temperatures as low as 200 degrees C. The different structures were characterized by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) together with X-ray photoelectron emission spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS).

In this study, we first characterize the interannual variability of this phenomenon by a thorough reanalysis of observations in order to establish reference time series. These quantitative indicators include 31 observed years for the yearly maximum mixed layer depth over the period 1980-2013 and a detailed multi-indicator description of the period 2007-2013. Then a 1980-2013 hindcast simulation is performed with a fully-coupled regional climate system model including the high-resolution representation of the regional atmosphere, ocean, land-surface and rivers. The simulation reproduces quantitatively well the mean behaviour and the large interannual variability of the DWF phenomenon. The model shows convection deeper than 1000 m in 2/3 of the modelled winters, a mean DWF rate equal to 0.35 Sv with maximum values of 1.7 (resp. 1.6) Sv in 2013 (resp. 2005). Using the model results, the winter-integrated buoyancy loss over the Gulf of Lions is identified as the primary driving factor of the DWF interannual variability and explains, alone, around 50 % of its variance. It is itself explained by the occurrence of few stormy days during winter. At daily scale, the Atlantic ridge weather regime is identified as favourable to strong buoyancy losses and therefore DWF, whereas the positive phase of the North Atlantic oscillation is unfavourable. The driving role of the vertical stratification in autumn, a measure of the water column inhibition to mixing, has also been analyzed. Combining both driving factors allows to explain more than 70 % of the interannual variance of the phenomenon and in particular the occurrence of the five strongest convective years of the model (1981, 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013). The model simulates qualitatively well the trends in the deep waters (warming, saltening, increase in the dense water volume, increase in the bottom water density) despite an underestimation of the salinity and density trends. These deep trends come from a heat and salt accumulation during the 1980s and the 1990s in the surface and intermediate layers of the Gulf of Lions before being transferred stepwise towards the deep layers when very convective years occur in 1999 and later. The salinity increase in the near Atlantic Ocean surface layers seems to be the external forcing that finally leads to these deep trends. In the future, our results may allow to better understand the behaviour of the DWF phenomenon in Mediterranean Sea simulations in hindcast, forecast, reanalysis or future climate change scenario modes. The robustness of the obtained results must be however confirmed in multi-model studies.

However, mixotrophic metabolism and the relative importance of inorganic and organic carbon assimilation within the most abundant cyanobacteria are still poorly understood. We explore the ability of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus to assimilate organic molecules with variable C:N:P composition and its modulation by light availability and photosynthetic impairment. We used a combination of radiolabelled molecules incubations with flow cytometry cell sorting to separate picoplankton groups from the western tropical South Pacific Ocean. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus assimilated glucose, leucine and ATP at all stations, but cell-specific assimilation rates of N and P containing molecules were significantly higher than glucose. Incubations in the dark or with an inhibitor of photosystem II resulted in reduced assimilation rates. Light-enhanced cell-specific glucose uptake was generally higher for cyanobacteria (approximate to 50%) than for the low nucleic acid fraction of bacterioplankton (LNA, approximate to 35%). Our results confirm previous findings, based mainly on cultures and genomic potentials, showing that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus have a flexible mixotrophic metabolism, but demonstrate that natural populations remain primarily photoautotrophs. Our findings indicate that mixotrophy by marine cyanobacteria is more likely to be an adaptation to low inorganic nutrient availability rather than a facultative pathway for carbon acquisition.

A reduced Landau-gyrofluid model for magnetic reconnection driven by electron inertia								JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS				84	4					725840401	10.1017/S002237781800051X			AUG 2018	2018	An electromagnetic reduced gyrofluid model for collisionless plasmas, accounting for electron inertia, finite ion Larmor radius effects and Landau-fluid closures for the electron fluid is derived by means of an asymptotic expansion from a parent gyrofluid model. In the absence of terms accounting for Landau damping, the model is shown to possess a non-canonical Hamiltonian structure. The corresponding Casimir invariants are derived and use is made thereof, in order to obtain a set of normal field variables, in terms of which the Poisson bracket and the model equations take a remarkably simple form. The inclusion of perpendicular temperature fluctuations generalizes previous Hamiltonian reduced fluid models and, in particular, the presence of ion perpendicular gyrofluid temperature fluctuations reflects into the presence of two new Lagrangian invariants governing the ion dynamics. The model is applied, in the cold-ion limit, to investigate numerically a magnetic reconnection problem. The Landau damping terms are shown to reduce, by decreasing the electron temperature fluctuations, the linear reconnection rate and to delay the nonlinear island growth. The saturated island width, on the other hand, is independent of Landau damping. The fraction of magnetic energy converted into perpendicular kinetic energy also appears to be unaffected by the Landau damping terms, which, on the other hand, dissipate parallel kinetic energy as well as free energy due to density and electron temperature fluctuations.

The global strategy consisted in i) identifying the major sources of S-metolachlor to the Bay, ii) monitoring these sources for 12 months, and iii) comparing modeled data in the Bay based on measured inputs, to chemical measurements made inside the Bay along with the 12-month source monitoring. Results first showed that the major S-metolachlor surface inputs to the Arcachon Bay are mainly from one single source. Modeled and measured data were in good agreement at 5 sites in the Bay, both in terms of concentration range and seasonal trends. Modeling thus offers a cost-effective solution for monitoring contaminants in transitional waters, overcoming in addition the technical limitations for measuring pg L-1 or lower levels in coastal waters. However, we highlighted that secondary sources may affect accuracy at local level.

Micronekton diel migration, community composition and trophic position within two biogeochemical provinces of the South West Indian Ocean: Insight from acoustics and stable isotopes								DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS				138				85	97		10.1016/j.dsr.2018.07.002			AUG 2018	2018	Spatial distribution, community composition and trophic roles of micronekton (crustaceans, fishes and squids) were investigated in the Indian South Subtropical Gyre (ISSG) province and the East African Coastal province (EAFR), by combining acoustic surveys, mid-water trawls and stable isotope analyses from scientific cruises conducted in 2009 and 2010. Mesopelagic micronekton performed diel vertical migrations in both provinces, from deep (400-740 m) to surface (0-200 m) layers at dusk and in the opposite direction at dawn, with some species migrating below 740 m. The EAFR province was more dynamic than the oligotrophic ISSG province, with enhanced eddy activity and enhanced yearly productivity. The active enrichment mechanisms in the EAFR, in terms of available primary production, led to high micronekton acoustic density (as a proxy of micronekton abundance) and large micronekton weight and abundance estimates from trawl data. Particulate organic matter in the EAFR exhibited greater enrichment in C-13 and N-15 compared to the ISSG and, consequently, tissues of selected micronekton organisms in the EAFR were more enriched in N-15 (higher delta N-15 values). In both provinces, micronekton encompassed a wide range of isotopic niches, with large overlaps between species. Micronekton and swordfish in the EAFR had an overlapping range of delta N-15 values, contrasting with the ISSG province where swordfish were two trophic levels higher than the sampled micronekton. Our results provide some evidence that the combined action of riverine input and the dynamics of eddies might influence productivity in the EAFR, and hence the abundance of micronekton and the enrichment of tissues in N-15, compared to the oligotrophic ISSG province.

Methods: Eleven endurance trained male athletes completed four experimental sessions including a 30-min fixed-RPE (15-Hard) cycling exercise in neutral (TMP-22 degrees C) and hot (HOT-37 degrees C) conditions, following a 60-min incongruent Stroop task (EXP) or passively watching documentary films (CON). Central and peripheral performances of the knee extensors were assessed before the cognitive task and after the exercise. Results: Although mental demand and effort were higher in EXP (P < 0.05), no effect of prior cognitive task was observed on subjective feelings of mental fatigue or decline in power output at a fixed RPE. Average exercise intensity was lower in HOT than TMP (3.14 +/- 0.09 W.kg vs. 3.42 +/- 0.10 W.kg(-1) respectively, P < 0.05). Skin temperature and warmth sensations were higher in HOT throughout the exercise (P < 0.05) but not thermal comfort. Central and peripheral parameters were not affected more in HOT than in TMP. Conclusion: Although the effects of combined stressors on the distortion of perceived exertion could not be verified, the greater decline in power output recorded in HOT than TMP suggest a high contribution of both perceptual and cardiovascular responses in the regulation of work rate when the subject is in mild hyperthermia.

Synthesized superlattices demonstrated a ferroelectric phase transition at a temperature of approximately 393 degrees C, which is far higher than the Curie temperature of BaTiO3 thin films and bulk samples. The dielectric permittivity of the superlattice reached more than 10(4) at maximum. As the electric field frequency increased, the dielectric constant of the studied superlattice decreased over the entire study temperature range, but position of the maximum dielectric constant remained the same with changing frequency. The temperature dependence of the inverse dielectric permittivity 1/" (T) for the studied samples shows that, in the investigated superlattice, both Curie- Weiss law and the law of " two" were followed. Additionally, the " (T) dependences showed practically no temperature hysteresis with heating and cooling. Samples of synthesized superlattices had a relatively small internal bias field, which was directed from the superlattice towards the substrate.

They have been extensively studied as models of complex systems as well as objects of mathematical and computational interest. Classically, the local rule of a cellular automaton is iterated synchronously over the entire configuration. However, the question of how asynchronous updates change the behaviour of a cellular automaton has become a major issue in recent years. Here, we analyse the elementary cellular automata rule space in terms of how many different one-step trajectories a rule would entail when taking into account all possible deterministic ways of updating the rule, for one time step, over all possible initial configurations. More precisely, we provide a characterisation of the elementary cellular automata, by means of their one-step maximum sensitivity to all possible update schedules, that is, the property that any change in the update schedule causes the rule's one-step trajectories also to change after one iteration. Although the one-step maximum sensitivity does not imply that the remainder of the time-evolutions will be distinct, it is a necessary condition for that. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previously reduced to a posterior heterotypic synonym of C. linum (O.F. Muller) Kutzing, C. stricter clearly differs from the latter by its small, light green, free-living filaments entangled in dense masses, the cells 0.5 to 1.6 (rarely 2) times as long as broad, with cell walls lamellate and broad up to 75-90 mu m thick, and by molecular data. Chaetomorpha stricta was rediscovered, in May 2011, in oligotrophic clear waters of a closed fishing pond in the Valle Cavallino (northern basin of the Venice Lagoon). A critical review of Chaetomorpha taxa reported in the Mediterranean Sea and a taxonomic key to the Mediterranean taxa currently accepted are presented.

Our local features are computed from binary patterns which incorporate the shape and motion cues for effective action recognition. Given pixel-level features, our approach estimates video local statistics in a hierarchical manner, where the distribution of pixel-level features and that of frame-level descriptors are modeled using single Gaussians. In this way, our approach constructs video descriptors directly from low-level features without resorting to codebook learning required by Bag-of-features (BoF) based approaches. In order to capture the spatial geometry and temporal order of a video, we use a spatio-temporal pyramid representation for each video. Our approach is validated on six benchmark datasets, i.e. MSRAction3D, MSRGesture3D, DHA, SKIG, UTD-MHAD and CAD-120. The experimental results show that our approach gives good performance on all the datasets. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on DHA, SKIG and UTD-MHAD datasets.

Resources are assumed to be renewable, i.e., they are not consumed by the operations and become available again after they have been released. The systems under consideration are modeled by a subclass of timed Petri nets called deterministic timed weighted marked graphs. In addition, we take into account infinite server semantics, i.e., the degree of self-concurrency of each transition is infinite. We propose an approach that provides an optimal solution, but has a high computational cost. For this reason, we also present two different approaches that can find suboptimal solutions with a reduced computational cost. The performances of the proposed approaches are compared by means of numerical simulations.

Increased intracortical inhibition previously reported at rest in OSA suggests central neuromuscular impairments in these patients. We hypothesized that (i) OSA patients demonstrate reduced knee extensor strength and endurance due to central impairments and (ii) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment improves neuromuscular function in these patients. Methods Twelve OSA patients and 11 healthy controls performed intermittent knee extensions until task failure before and after 8 wk of CPAP treatment or control period. Maximal voluntary contraction, voluntary activation and corticospinal excitability and inhibition assessed by single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured before and during the fatiguing task. Results Time to exhaustion was lower in OSA (before CPAP treatment: 1008 549 s; after CPAP treatment: 975 +/- 378 s) compared with controls (before control period: 1476 +/- 633 s; after control period: 1274 +/- 506 s; P = 0.017). Obstructive sleep apnea patients had reduced maximal voluntary contraction and VA(TMS) compared with controls throughout the fatiguing task as well as increased intracortical inhibition (all P < 0.05). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment did not induce any changes in neuromuscular function (P > 0.05 for all parameters). Conclusions This study demonstrates that severe OSA patients have cortical impairments which are likely contributing to their reduced knee extensors strength and endurance. Both cortical impairments and neuromuscular function are not improved after 8 wk of CPAP treatment.

However, neither the coach nor the visually impaired kayaker feel at ease with such a guiding due to the amount of noise generated by the frequent vocal interactions. This paper describes a novel concept of sensory navigation guide meant to help kayakers with visual disabilities to practice sea kayaking in an autonomous way. The innovation here consists in providing kayakers with wristbands that automatically vibrate left or right, depending on the predefined trajectory to be followed. The main contributions of this work include an original navigation algorithm based on GPS feedback to track a corridor-shaped path on the sea and the definition of specific metrics to analyze the performance of the kayakers along the ride. Experiments carried out on a population of 10 visually impaired kayakers and 10 sighted kayakers showed convincing results. A satisfaction survey confirmed that all participants acknowledged the added value of the system in terms of increased autonomy. Most of the visually impaired participants also enjoyed a greater sports entertainment experience thanks to this guiding system, which can be extended to other kinds of water sports.

To play this sensing role, a redox tracer was incorporated inside the binding cavities of a cross-linked MIP, as a functional monomer during the synthesis step. Ferrocenylmethyl methacrylate was used for this purpose. It was associated with 4-vinylpyridine as a co-functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker for the recognition of the endocrine disruptor, Bisphenol A (BPA), as a target. Microbeads of e-MIP and e-NIP (corresponding non imprinted polymer) were obtained via precipitation polymerization in acetonitrile. The presence of ferrocene inside the polymers was assessed via FTIR and elemental analysis and the polymers microstructure was characterized by SEM and nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments. Binding isotherms and batch selectivity experiments evidenced the presence of binding cavities inside the e-MIP and its high affinity for BPA compared to carbamazepine and ketoprofen. e-MIP (and e-NIP) microbeads were then incorporated in a graphite-hydroxyethylcellulose composite paste to prepare SPCE. Electrochemical properties of e-MIP-SPCE revealed a high sensitivity in the presence of BPA in aqueous medium compared to e-NIP-SPCE with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.06 nM. Selectivity towards carbamazepine and ketoprofen was also observed with the e-MIP-SPCE.

J	Sapienza, Anna; Barrat, Alain; Cattuto, Ciro; Gauvin, Laetitia								Estimating the outcome of spreading processes on networks with incomplete information: A dimensionality reduction approach								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				98	1						10.1103/PhysRevE.98.012317;012317			JUL 30 2018	2018	Recent advances in data collection have facilitated the access to time-resolved human proximity data that can conveniently be represented as temporal networks of contacts between individuals. While the structural and dynamical information revealed by this type of data is fundamental to investigate how information or diseases propagate in a population, data often suffer from incompleteness, which possibly leads to biased estimations in data-driven models. A major challenge is thus to estimate the outcome of spreading processes occurring on temporal networks built from partial information. To cope with this problem, we devise an approach based on non-negative tensor factorization, a dimensionality reduction technique from multilinear algebra. The key idea is to learn a low-dimensional representation of the temporal network built from partial information and to use it to construct a surrogate network similar to the complete original network. To test our method, we consider several human-proximity networks, on which we perform resampling experiments to simulate a loss of data. Using our approach on the resulting partial networks, we build a surrogate version of the complete network for each. We then compare the outcome of a spreading process on the complete networks (nonaltered by a loss of data) and on the surrogate networks. We observe that the epidemic sizes obtained using the surrogate networks are in good agreement with those measured on the complete networks. Finally, we propose an extension of our framework that can leverage additional data, when available, to improve the surrogate network when the data loss is particularly large.

Unlike most characterized MarR repressors that respond to small metabolites at concentrations in the millimolar range, repression by CouR is alleviated by the 800-Da ligand p-coumaroyl-CoA with high affinity and specificity. Here we report the crystal structures of ligand-free CouR as well as the complex with p-coumaroyl-CoA, each to 2.1-angstrom resolution, and the 2.85-angstrom resolution cocrystal structure of CouR bound to an oligonucleotide bearing the cognate DNA operator sequence. In combination with binding experiments that uncover specific residues important for ligand and DNA recognition, these structures provide glimpses of a MarR family repressor in all possible states, providing an understanding of the molecular basis of DNA binding and the conformation alterations that accompany ligand-induced dissociation for activation of the operon.

The NC variability is dominated by a synoptic response to wind events, even though the dataset also evidences early stages of transition from late summer to fall-winter conditions. With weak winds, the current is mostly zonal and in geostrophic balance even at the surface, with a zonal transport associated with the NC of approximate to 1 Sv. Strong westerly wind events (longer than 2-3 days) induce an interplay between the direct-wind-induced ageostrophic response and the geostrophic component: upwelling is observed, with offshore surface transport, surface cooling, flattening of the isopycnals, and reduced zonal geostrophic transport (0.50.7 Sv). The sea surface response to wind events, as observed by the HF radar, shows total currents rotated at approximate to 55 to 90 degrees to the right of the wind. Performing a decomposition between geostrophic and ageostrophic components of the surface currents, the wind-driven ageostrophic component is found to rotate by approximate to -25 to -30 degrees to the right of the wind. The ageostrophic component magnitude corresponds to approximate to 2% of the wind speed.

Due to electron-electron interactions, fractional excitations emerge along the edge. Their detailed structure is analyzed by evaluating the nonequilibrium momentum distributions associated with the different edge channels. We provide results for a generic time-dependent drive both in the stationary regime and for intermediate times, where the overlap between fractionalized wave packets carries relevant information on interaction strength. As a particular example we focus on a Lorentzian drive, which provides a clear signature of the minimal excitations known as Levitons. Here we argue that inner-channel fractionalized excitations can be exploited to extract information about interchannel interactions. We further confirm this idea by calculating the zero frequency noise due to the partitioning of these excitations at a quantum point contact and we propose a measurable quantity as a tool to directly probe electron-electron interactions and determine the so-called mixing angle of copropagating quantum Hall channels.

Thus, N-2 fixation sustains a significant part of the global primary production by supplying the most common limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth. The "Oligotrophy to UlTra-oligotrophy PACific Experiment"(OUTPACE) improved the data coverage of the western tropical South Pacific, an area recently recognized as a hotspot of N-2 fixation. This new development leads us to develop and test an explicit N-2 fixation formulation based on the Trichodesmium physiology (the most studied nitrogen fixer) within a 3-D coupled dynamical-biogeochemical model (ROMS-PISCES). We performed a climatological numerical simulation that is able to reproduce the main physical (e.g. sea surface temperature) and biogeochemical patterns (nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations, as well as N-2 fixation) in the tropical Pacific. This simulation displayed a Trichodesmium regional distribution that extends from 150 degrees E to 120 degrees W in the south tropical Pacific, and from 120 degrees E to 140 degrees W in the north tropical Pacific. The local simulated maximuma were found around islands (Hawaii, Fiji, Samoa, New Caledonia, Vanuatu). We assessed that 15% of the total primary produc-tion may be due to Trichodesmium in the low-nutrient lowchlorophyll regions (LNLC) of the tropical Pacific. Comparison between our explicit and the often used (in biogeochemical models) implicit parameterization of N-2 fixation showed that the latter leads to an underestimation of N-2 fixation rates by about 25% in LNLC regions. Finally, we established that iron fluxes from island sediments control the spatial distribution of Trichodesmium biomasses in the western tropical South Pacific. Note, this last result does not take into account the iron supply from rivers and hydrothermal sources, which may well be of importance in a region known for its strong precipitation rates and volcanic activity.

These filtering media are based on nanoporous matrices doped with indigo carmine that reacts selectively with O-3. The nanoporous materials, produced via the sol-gel process using functionalized silicon alkoxides as precursors, are tailored for the trapping of O-3. Depending on the nature of the filter, it is possible to entirely trap O-3 and allow NO2 to partially pass over a certain range of concentration. For air depollution purpose, selected filters that efficiently trap both O-3 and NO2 were exposed to harsh conditions under high concentrations of O-3 (350-475 ppb) and humidity (RH: 72%, T = 21 degrees C). Their trapping efficiency and lifetime are determined and compared with those of activated carbon. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phylogenetic analyses of this group of viruses, tentatively referred to as the family "Megaviridae", suggest that it has an ancient origin that may predate the emergence of major eukaryotic lineages. Environmental genomics has since revealed that Megaviridae represents one of the most abundant and diverse groups of viruses in the ocean. In the present study, we compared the taxon richness and phylogenetic diversity of Megaviridae, Bacteria, and Archaea using DNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a common marker gene. By leveraging existing microbial metagenomic data, we found higher richness and phylogenetic diversity in this single viral family than in the two prokaryotic domains. We also obtained results showing that the evolutionary rate alone cannot account for the observed high diversity of Megaviridae lineages. These results suggest that the Megaviridae family has a deep co-evolutionary history with diverse marine protists since the early "Big-Bang" radiation of the eukaryotic tree of life.

Gut fermentation at the time of a dive exacerbates DCS due to endogenous hydrogen production. We sought to investigate whether medium-term stimulation of fermentation as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced acceleration of bowel transit before diving exacerbates DCS in rats. Seven days before an experimental dry dive, 60 rats were randomly divided in two groups: an experimental group treated with PEG (n = 30) and an untreated control group (n = 30). Exhaled hydrogen was measured before the dive. Following hyperbaric exposure, we assessed for signs of DCS. After anaesthetisation, arterial blood was drawn to assay inflammatory cytokines and markers of oxidative stress. PEG led to a significant increase in exhaled H-2 (35 ppm [10-73] compared with control 7 ppm [2-15]; p = 0.001). The probability of death was reduced in PEG-treated rats (PEG: 17% [95% CI 4-41] vs control: 50% [95% CI 26-74]; p = 0.034). In addition, inflammatory markers were reduced, and the antioxidant activity of glutathione peroxidase was significantly increased (529.2 U. l(-1) [485.4-569.0] versus 366.4 U. l(-1) [317.6-414.8]; p = 0.004). Thus, gut fermentation might have a positive effect on DCS. The antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of the fermentation by-products H-2 and butyrate may explain these results.

With just one click, the abundance and location of target sequences are visualized on world maps as well as their taxonomic distribution. Interactive results panels allow for adjusting cutoffs for alignment quality and displaying the abundances of genes in the context of environmental features (temperature, nutrients, etc.) measured at the time of sampling. The ease of use enables non-bioinformaticians to explore quantitative and contextualized information on genes of interest in the global ocean ecosystem. Currently the Ocean Gene Atlas is deployed with (i) the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog (OM-RGC) comprising 40 million non-redundant mostly prokaryotic gene sequences associated with both Tara Oceans and Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) gene abundances and (ii) the Marine Atlas of Tara Ocean Unigenes (MATOU) composed of > 116 million eukaryote unigenes. Additional datasets will be added upon availability of further marine environmental datasets that provide the required complement of sequence assemblies, raw reads and contextual environmental parameters.

Even if no molecules have been deposited on the metallic surface, a clear Raman signal is observed. A very intense and sharp peak around 2,100cm(-1) together with low-wavenumber modes are visible. The comparison between the experimental spectra and those obtained using density functional theory calculations confirms that these new modes are associated with the cyanide compound Au(CN)(2)(-). This proves the high sensitivity of SERS for the chemical analysis of metallic surfaces. It also shows that the pollution should be carefully taken into account in SERS analysis. We also demonstrate that high power laser illumination transforms these toxic compounds into carbon species; this method can be used to clean SERS substrates.

Polymer Schwarzschild black hole: An effective metric								EPL				123	2					20006	10.1209/0295-5075/123/20006			JUL 2018	2018	We consider the modified Einstein equations obtained in the framework of effective spherically symmetric polymer models inspired by loop quantum gravity. When one takes into account the anomaly free pointwise holonomy quantum corrections, the modification of Einstein equations is parametrized by a function f(x) of one phase space variable. We solve explicitly these equations for a static interior black-hole geometry and find the effective metric describing the trapped region, inside the black hole, for any f(x). This general resolution allows to take into account a standard ambiguity inherent to the polymer regularization: namely the choice of the spin j labelling the SU(2)-representation of the holonomy corrections. When j = 1/2, the function f(x) is the usual sine function used in the polymer litterature. For this simple case, the effective exterior metric remains the classical Schwarzschild's one but acquires modifications inside the hole. The interior metric describes a regular trapped region and presents strong similarities with the Reissner-Nordstrom metric, with a new inner horizon generated by quantum effects. We discuss the gluing of our interior solution to the exterior Schwarzschild metric and the challenge to extend the solution outside the trapped region due to covariance requirement. By starting from the anomaly free polymer regularization for inhomogeneous spherically symmetric geometry, and then reducing to the homogeneous interior problem, we provide an alternative treatment to existing polymer interior black-hole models which focus directly on the interior geometry, ignoring the covariance issue when introducing the polymer regularization.

It has the unusual ability to anaerobically produce nitrite from ammonium in the presence of MnIV. To gain insight into their metabolic capabilities, global mRNA expression patterns were investigated by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR in cells growing with lactate and ammonium as carbon and nitrogen sources, and with either MnIV or nitrate as electron acceptors. Genes exhibiting higher expression levels in the presence of MnIV belonged to functional categories of carbohydrate, coenzyme, lipid metabolisms and inorganic ion transport. The comparative transcriptomic pattern between MnIV and NO3 revealed that the strain presented an ammonium limitation status with MnIV, despite the presence of a non-limiting concentration of ammonium under both culture conditions. In addition, in the presence of MnIV, ntrB/nrtC regulators, ammonium channel, nitrogen regulatory protein P-II, glutamine synthetase and asparagine synthetase glutamine-dependent genes were over-represented. Under the nitrate condition, the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of several amino acids was increased. Finally, the expression level of genes associated with the general stress response was also amplified in both conditions and among them, katE, a putative catalase/peroxidase present on several Shewanella genomes, was highly expressed with a median value relatively higher in the MnIV condition.

Twenty participants (14.3 +/- 0.5 years; 176.8 +/- 12.5 cm; 74.5 +/- 9.8 kg) performed pre- and post-tests interspersed by 6 weeks of SSG or HIIT training. Testing sessions consisted of the 30-15 intermittent fitness test and an RS sequence (2 bouts of 15 seconds). During RS, muscle oxygenation parameters (tissue saturation index [TSI, postsprint muscle reoxygenation rate) were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that both training interventions similarly improved maximal aerobic speed (V-IFT, 3.4 and 4.1%, respectively, for HIIT and SSG, P < 0.05) as well as RS ability (smaller percentage decrement by 62.5 and 21.6%, respectively, for HIIT and SSG, P < 0.05). Both training interventions also resulted in a greater Delta TSI during the second sprint (47.8-114%, P < 0.05) and significant improvements in postsprint reoxygenation after both sprints (+23.0 to +107.7%). Finally, the variation in muscle reoxygenation after sprint 1 was significantly associated with improvements in aerobic (Delta V-IFT, r = 0.61, P = 0.008) and anaerobic (Delta% Dec during RS, r = -0.487, P = 0.028) performances. The current study has observed that SSG and HIIT resulted in similar improvements in aerobic and anaerobic variables and a better muscle oxygenation capacity during RS. Coaches should be aware that both trainings are applicable methodologies to improve in-season aerobic and anaerobic fitness capacities in junior basketball players.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms driving further distribution after the initial establishment of non-native species remain largely unresolved, especially in marine systems. Ocean currents can be a major driver governing range occupancy, but this has not been accounted for in most invasion ecology studies so far. We investigate how well initial establishment areas are interconnected to later occupancy regions to test for the potential role of ocean currents driving secondary spread dynamics in order to infer invasion corridors and the source-sink dynamics of a non-native holoplanktonic biological probe species on a continental scale. Location: Western Eurasia. Time period: 1980s-2016. Major taxa studied: 'Comb jelly' Mnemiopsis leidyi. Methods: Based on 12,400 geo-referenced occurrence data, we reconstruct the invasion history of M. leidyi in western Eurasia. We model ocean currents and calculate their stability to match the temporal and spatial spread dynamics with large-scale connectivity patterns via ocean currents. Additionally, genetic markers are used to test the predicted connectivity between subpopulations. Results: Ocean currents can explain secondary spread dynamics, matching observed range expansions and the timing of first occurrence of our holoplanktonic non-native biological probe species, leading to invasion corridors in western Eurasia. In northern Europe, regional extinctions after cold winters were followed by rapid recolonizations at a speed of up to 2,000 km per season. Source areas hosting year-round populations in highly interconnected regions can re-seed genotypes over large distances after local extinctions. Main conclusions: Although the release of ballast water from container ships may contribute to the dispersal of non-native species, our results highlight the importance of ocean currents driving secondary spread dynamics. Highly interconnected areas hosting invasive species are crucial for secondary spread dynamics on a continental scale. Invasion risk assessments should consider large-scale connectivity patterns and the potential source regions of non-native marine species.

We show that such a distribution belongs to the family of extreme value laws, whose parameters, namely the extremal index, allow us to get a detailed description of the probability of synchronization. Theoretical results are supported by robust numerical computations that allow us to go beyond the theoretical framework provided and are potentially applicable to physically relevant systems.

Two strategies are commonly used for this purpose: adjusting heating rates and/or adding microalloying elements. The present work investigates the effect of heating rate and microalloying elements Ti, Nb, and Mo on recrystallization kinetics during annealing in various cold-rolled Dual-Phase steel grades. The use of combined experimental and modeling approaches allows a deeper understanding of the separate influence of heating rate and the addition of microalloying elements. The comparative effect of Ti, Nb, and Mo as solute elements and as precipitates on ferrite recrystallization is also clarified. It is shown that solute drag has the largest delaying effect on recrystallization in the present case and that the order of solute drag effectiveness of microalloying elements is Nb > Mo > Ti.

The dual problem reads nicely as a linear programming problem, and our main result states that there is no duality gap. Further, we provide necessary and sufficient optimality conditions, and we show that our duality principle can be reformulated as a min-max result which is quite useful for numerical implementations. As an example, we illustrate the application of our method to a celebrated free boundary problem. The results were announced in Bouchitt, and FragalA (C R Math Acad Sci Paris 353(4):375-379, 2015).

Samples of black smoker chimney from Rainbow site on the Atlantic mid-oceanic ridge have been harvested for enriching exoelectrogens in microbial electrolysis cells under hyperthermophilic (80 degrees C) condition. Two enrichments were performed in a BioElectrochemical System specially designed: one from direct inoculation of crushed chimney and the other one from inoculation of a pre-cultivation on iron (III) oxide. In both experiments, a current production was observed from 2.4 A/m(2) to 5.8 A/m(2) with a set anode potential of -0.110 V vs Ag/AgCl. Taxonomic affiliation of the exoelectrogen communities obtained on the electrode exhibited a specific enrichment of Archaea belonging to Thermococcales and Archeoglobales orders, even when both inocula were dominated by Bacteria.

J	Bock, Nicholas; Van Wambeke, France; Dion, Moira; Duhamel, Solange								Microbial community structure in the western tropical South Pacific								BIOGEOSCIENCES				15	12			3909	3925		10.5194/bg-15-3909-2018			JUN 29 2018	2018	Oligotrophic regions play a central role in global biogeochemical cycles, with microbial communities in these areas representing an important term in global carbon budgets. While the general structure of microbial communities has been well documented in the global ocean, some remote regions such as the western tropical South Pacific (WTSP) remain fundamentally unexplored. Moreover, the biotic and abiotic factors constraining microbial abundances and distribution remain not well resolved. In this study, we quantified the spatial (vertical and horizontal) distribution of major microbial plankton groups along a transect through the WTSP during the austral summer of 2015, capturing important autotrophic and heterotrophic assemblages including cytometrically determined abundances of non-pigmented protists (also called flagellates). Using environmental parameters (e.g., nutrients and light availability) as well as statistical analyses, we estimated the role of bottom-up and top-down controls in constraining the structure of the WTSP microbial communities in biogeochemically distinct regions. At the most general level, we found a "typical tropical structure", characterized by a shallow mixed layer, a clear deep chlorophyll maximum at all sampling sites, and a deep nitracline. Prochlorococcus was especially abundant along the transect, accounting for 68 +/- 10.6% of depth-integrated phytoplankton biomass. Despite their relatively low abundances, pico-phytoeukaryotes (PPE) accounted for up to 26 +/- 11.6% of depth-integrated phytoplankton biomass, while Synechococcus accounted for only 6 +/- 6.9 %. Our results show that the microbial community structure of the WTSP is typical of highly stratified regions, and underline the significant contribution to total biomass by PPE populations. Strong relationships between N-2 fixation rates and plankton abundances demonstrate the central role of N-2 fixation in regulating ecosystem processes in the WTSP, while comparative analyses of abundance data suggest microbial community structure to be increasingly regulated by bottom-up processes under nutrient limitation, possibly in response to shifts in abundances of high nucleic acid bacteria (HNA).

ZnO is a good candidate material to be inserted as a tunneling insulator layer at the metal-semiconductor junction. A key consideration in many modern devices is the atomic structure of the hetero-interface, which often ultimately governs the electronic or chemical process of interest. Here, a complementary suite of in situ synchrotron X-ray techniques (fluorescence, reflectivity and absorption) as well as modeling is used to investigate both structural and chemical evolution during the initial growth of ZnO by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on In0.53Ga0.47As substrates. Prior to steady-state growth behavior, we discover a transient regime characterized by two stages. First, substrate-inhibited ZnO growth takes place on InGaAs terraces. This leads eventually to the formation of a 1 nm-thick, two-dimensional (2D) amorphous layer. Second, the growth behavior and its modeling suggest the occurrence of dense island formation, with an aspect ratio and surface roughness that depends sensitively on the growth condition. Finally, ZnO ALD on In0.53Ga0.47As is characterized by 2D steady-state growth with a linear growth rate of 0.21 nm cy(-1), as expected for layer-by-layer ZnO ALD.

Stepping boundary of external force-controlled perturbations of varying durations: Comparison of experimental data and model simulations								JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS				75				89	95		10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.05.010			JUN 25 2018	2018	This study investigated the stepping boundary - the force that can be resisted without stepping - for force-controlled perturbations of different durations. Twenty-two healthy young adults (19-37 years old) were instructed to try not to step in response to 86 different force/time combinations of forward waist-pulls. The forces at which 50% of subjects stepped (F-50) were identified for each tested perturbation durations. Results showed that F50 decreased hyperbolically when the perturbation's duration increased and converged toward a constant value (about 10% BW) for longer perturbations (over 1500 ms). The effect of perturbation duration was critical for the shortest perturbations (less than 1 s). In parallel, a simple function was proposed to estimate this stepping boundary. Considering the dynamics of a linear inverted pendulum + foot model and simple balance recovery reactions, we could express the maximum pulling force that can be withstood without stepping as a simple function of the perturbation duration. When used with values of the main model parameters determined experimentally, this function replicated adequately the experimental results. This study demonstrates for the first time that perturbation duration has a major influence on the outcomes of compliant perturbations such as force-controlled pulls. The stepping boundary corresponds to a constant perturbation force-duration product and is largely explained by only two parameters: the reaction time and the displacement of the center of pressure within the functional base of support. Future work should investigate pathological populations and additional parameters characterizing the perturbation time-profile such as the time derivative of the perturbation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet the fate of the diazotrophderived N (DDN) in the planktonic food web is poorly understood. The main goals of this study were (i) to quantify how much of DDN is released to the dissolved pool during N-2 fixation and how much is transferred to bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton, and (ii) to compare the DDN release and transfer efficiencies under contrasting N-2 fixation activity and diversity in the oligotrophic waters of the western tropical South Pacific (WTSP) Ocean. We used nanometre-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) coupled with N-15(2) isotopic labelling and flow cytometry cell sorting to track the DDN transfer to plankton, in regions where the diazotroph community was dominated by either Trichodesmium or by UCYN-B. After 48 h, 2 similar to 20-40% of the N-2 fixed during the experiment was released to the dissolved pool when Trichodesmium dominated, while the DDN release was not quantifiable when UCYNB dominated; similar to 7-15% of the total fixed N (net N-2 fixation + release) was transferred to non-diazotrophic plankton within 48 h, with higher transfer efficiencies (15 +/- 3 %) when UCYN-B dominated as compared to when Trichodesmium dominated (9 +/- 3 %). The pico-cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus were the primary beneficiaries of the DDN transferred (similar to 65-70 %), followed by heterotrophic bacteria (similar to 23-34 %). The DDN transfer in bacteria was higher (34 +/- 7 %) in the UCYN-B-dominating experiment compared to the Trichodesmium-dominating experiments (24 +/- 5 %). Regarding higher trophic levels, the DDN transfer to the dominant zooplankton species was less efficient when the diazotroph community was dominated by Trichodesmium (similar to 5-9% of the DDN transfer) than when it was dominated by UCYN-B (similar to 28 +/- 13% of the DDN transfer). To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantification of DDN release and transfer to phytoplankton, bacteria and zooplankton communities in open ocean waters. It reveals that despite UCYN-B fix N-2 at lower rates compared to Trichodesmium in the WTSP, the DDN from UCYN-B is much more available and efficiently transferred to the planktonic food web than the DDN originating from Trichodesmium.

Four sediment cores were immediately analyzed in order to determine the initial distribution (T-0) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), pH and dissolved oxygen (O-2) in the porewaters and to quantify sediment-water fluxes. Four other cores were kept submerged in the laboratory for 25 days with ambient seawater (pa r = 8.12) and the remaining four cores were incubated with acidified seawater (average pH offset of -0.68). This acidification experiment was carried out in an open-flow system, in the dark and at in-situ temperature (15 degrees C). Every three days, sediment-water fluxes (DIC, TA, pH, O-2 and nutrients) were determined using a whole core 12-h incubation technique. Additionally, vertical O-2 and pH microprofiles were regularly recorded in the first 2 cm of the sediment during the entire experiment. At the end of the experiment, TA, DIC and Ca2+ concentrations were analyzed in the porewaters and the abundance and taxonomic composition of meiofaunal organisms were assessed. The saturation states of the porewaters with respect to calcite and aragonite were over-saturated but under-saturated with respect to 12 mol% Mg-calcite, in both acidified and non-acidified treatments. The sediment-water fluxes of TA and DIC increased in the acidified treatment, likely as a consequence of enhanced carbonate dissolution. In contrast, the acidification of the overlying water did not significantly affect the O-2 and nutrients fluxes at the SWI. Meiofaunal abundance decreased in both treatments over the duration of the experiment, but the organisms seemed unaffected by the acidification. Our results demonstrate that carbonate dissolution increased under acidified conditions but other parameters, such as microbial redox processes, were apparently not affected by the pH decrease, at least during the duration of our experiment. The dissolution of sedimentary carbonates and the associated release of TA may potentially buffer bottom water, depending on the intensity of the TA flux, the TA/DIC ratio, vertical mixing and, therefore, the residence time of bottom water. Under certain conditions, this process may mitigate the effect of ocean acidification on benthic ecosystems.

Elephant quantum walk								PHYSICAL REVIEW A				97	6					062112	10.1103/PhysRevA.97.062112			JUN 13 2018	2018	We introduce an analytically treatable discrete time quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice which combines non-Markovianity and hyperballistic diffusion associated with a Gaussian whose variance sigma(2)(t) grows cubicly with time sigma alpha t(3). These properties have have been numerically found in several systems, namely, tight-binding lattice models. For its rules, our model can be understood as the quantum version of the classical non-Markovian "elephant random walk" process for which the quantum coin operator only changes the value of the diffusion constant although, contrarily, to the classical coin.

The survival of these organisms relies on a high bioavailable iron supply whose origin and fluxes remain unknown. Here, we measured high dissolved iron (DFe) concentrations (up to 66 nM) in the euphotic layer, extending zonally over 10 degrees longitude (174 E-175 W) at similar to 20 degrees S latitude. DFe atmospheric fluxes were at the lower end of reported values of the remote ocean and could not explain the high DFe concentrations measured in the water column in the vicinity of Tonga. We argue that the high DFe concentrations may be sustained by a submarine source, also characterized by freshwater input and recorded as salinity anomalies by Argo float in situ measurements and atlas data. The observed negative salinity anomalies are reproduced by simulations from a general ocean circulation model. Submarine iron sources reaching the euphotic layer may impact nitrogen fixation across the whole region.

Physical factors induced by the turbulent flow play a crucial role in regulating marine ecosystems. However, while large-scale open-ocean dynamics is well described by geostrophy, the role of multiscale transport processes in coastal regions is still poorly understood due to the lack of continuous high-resolution observations. Here, the influence of small-scale dynamics (O(3.5-25) km, i.e. spanning upper submesoscale and mesoscale processes) on surface phytoplankton derived from satellite chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is studied using Lagrangian metrics computed from High-Frequency Radar currents. The combination of complementary Lagrangian diagnostics, including the Lagrangian divergence along fluid trajectories, provides an improved description of the 3D flow geometry which facilitates the interpretation of two non-exclusive physical mechanisms affecting phytoplankton dynamics and patchiness. Attracting small-scale fronts, unveiled by backwards Lagrangian Coherent Structures, are associated to negative divergence where particles and Chl-a standing stocks cluster. Filaments of positive divergence, representing large accumulated upward vertical velocities and suggesting accrued injection of subsurface nutrients, match areas with large Chl-a concentrations. Our findings demonstrate that an accurate characterization of small-scale transport processes is necessary to comprehend bio-physical interactions in coastal seas.

It is based on the introduction of a new shape signature (LIP-signature) which is invariant to additive noise, non-linear deformations, and geometric transformations such as rotation, scaling and translation (RST transformations). The proposed shape signature contains meaningful geometric information that can be easily exploited for a unifying approach of orientation/linearity measurement by detecting the possible orientation and the orientation merit of a given shape. In addition, a simple yet effective shape descriptor is also introduced by taking into account the beneficial properties of LIP-signature. Our methods can be directly applied to complex shapes composed of several closed contours or to degraded shapes being affected by additive noise, occlusion or other non-linear deformations. Different experiments validate the interest of the proposed approach.

The trajectory of three-dimensional Bragg peaks in reciprocal space during tensile testing allowed for measurements of the evolution of strains and rotations of the nanowire, thus sensitively uncovering the full deformation geometry of the nanowire. The transition from elastic to plastic deformation is accompanied by rotations of the nanowire as quantified by analysis of the motion of Bragg peaks, showing the importance of boundary conditions in interpreting nanoscale mechanical deformations.

Up to now, 3D printing was mainly used for the manufacture of small units such as flow detection cells, preconcentration units or mixing systems. In the present study, a new 3D printed lab-on-valve system was developed to selectively quantify lead and cadmium in water. Different technologies were compared for lab-on-valve 3D printing. Printed test units have shown that stereolithography or digital light processing are satisfactory techniques for creating complex lab-on-valve units. The lab-on-valve system was composed of two columns, eight peripheral ports and a central port, and a coil integrating baffles to increase mixing possibilities. A selective extraction of lead was first carried out by TrisKem Pb-TM Resin column. Then, cadmium not retained on the first column was extracted on a second column of Amberlite((R)) IR 120 resin. In a following step, lead and cadmium were eluted with ammonium oxalate and potassium iodide, respectively. Finally, the two metals were sequentially detected by the same Rhod-5N(TM) fluorescent reagent. This 3D printed lab-on-valve flow system allowed us to quantify lead and cadmium with a linear response from 0.2 to 15 mu gL(-1) and detection limits of 0.17 and 0.20 mu gL(-1) for lead and cadmium, respectively, which seems adapted for natural water analysis.

Then, by weakening the singularities of the set of admissible coefficients, we manage to reduce the set of data that still guaranties unique recovery of such a coefficient. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first claiming unique determination of unbounded time-dependent coefficients, which is motivated by the problem of determining general nonlinear terms appearing in nonlinear wave equations.

Prediction of the behavior of the beach profile configuration in response to natural and anthropogenic changes using the concept of equilibrium beach profile (EBP) could be useful in finding the most suitable measure to address the erosion problem. Field investigation data of 11 beaches along the eastern tombolo were supplied for this study. and a nonlinear fitting technique was applied to estimate the best parameter values of seven empirical formulations of the relevant EBP. All of the observed beach profiles could be described by a single function, but a single EBP was inadequate to represent all ofthe beach profiles observed. The variation found could be explained in terms of longshore variation of bathymetty, sediment size, and wave parameters. Analysis of the validity of the EBPs revealed that a representative EBP of each beach is governed by different equilibrium parameters.

J	Marxer, Ricard; Barker, Jon; Alghamdi, Najwa; Maddock, Steve								The impact of the Lombard effect on audio and visual speech recognition systems								SPEECH COMMUNICATION				100				58	68		10.1016/j.specom.2018.04.006			JUN 2018	2018	When producing speech in noisy backgrounds talkers reflexively adapt their speaking style in ways that increase speech-in-noise intelligibility. This adaptation, known as the Lombard effect, is likely to have an adverse effect on the performance of automatic speech recognition systems that have not been designed to anticipate it. However, previous studies of this impact have used very small amounts of data and recognition systems that lack modern adaptation strategies. This paper aims to rectify this by using a new audio-visual Lombard corpus containing speech from 54 different speakers - significantly larger than any previously available - and modern state-of-the-art speech recognition techniques. The paper is organised as three speech-in-noise recognition studies. The first examines the case in which a system is presented with Lombard speech having been exclusively trained on normal speech. It was found that the Lombard mismatch caused a significant decrease in performance even if the level of the Lombard speech was normalised to match the level of normal speech. However, the size of the mismatch was highly speaker-dependent thus explaining conflicting results presented in previous smaller studies. The second study compares systems trained in matched conditions (i.e., training and testing with the same speaking style). Here the Lombard speech affords a large increase in recognition performance. Part of this is due to the greater energy leading to a reduction in noise masking, but performance improvements persist even after the effect of signal-to-noise level difference is compensated. An analysis across speakers shows that the Lombard speech energy is spectro-temporally distributed in a way that reduces energetic masking, and this reduction in masking is associated with an increase in recognition performance. The final study repeats the first two using a recognition system training on visual speech. In the visual domain, performance differences are not confounded by differences in noise masking. It was found that in matched-conditions Lombard speech supports better recognition performance than normal speech. The benefit was consistently present across all speakers but to a varying degree. Surprisingly, the Lombard benefit was observed to a small degree even when training on mismatched non-Lombard visual speech, i.e., the increased clarity of the Lombard speech outweighed the impact of the mismatch. The paper presents two generally applicable conclusions: i) systems that are designed to operate in noise will benefit from being trained on well-matched Lombard speech data, ii) the results of speech recognition evaluations that employ artificial speech and noise mixing need to be treated with caution: they are overly-optimistic to the extent that they ignore a significant source of mismatch but at the same time overly-pessimistic in that they do not anticipate the potential increased intelligibility of the Lombard speaking style.

We investigated the microbial community composition and succession in coastal marine biofilms on plastic. Samples were collected over 75 days of immersion with strengthened samplings during the early stages of biofilm establishment. Biofilm composition was estimated using Illumina Miseq and microbial community interactions were assessed through microbial association network analysis. In silico analyses showed that primers used in most of previous studies considerably underestimated marine biofilm diversity. Unintentionally ignored so far, we showed that Flavobacteriia might be key actors in the functioning of marine biofilms. Gamma-proteobacteria from the genus Oleibacter strongly dominated microbial communities during the first hours of biofilm formation. These pioneer communities were quickly replaced by alpha-proteobacteria and Flavobacteriia. Bacterial communities exhibited fast temporal structure dynamics with taxa displaying rapid increases and declines. A total of 90% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were intermittent or ephemeral reinforcing the conclusion that marine biofilms are highly dynamics. With 2/3 of positive significant connections between bacterial OTUs, microbial biofilm communities appear to be more inclined to develop inter-specific cooperation rather than competition and might thus form sets of functional guilds with mutual metabolic exchanges.

The novelty of our result is that, contrary to the previous works, we do not need any measurement on the final time. We also show how this result can be used to establish a stability estimate for the problem of determining the nonlinear term in a semilinear parabolic equation from the corresponding "linearized" Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. This is the first result for this kind of inverse problems. The key ingredient in our analysis is a parabolic version of an elliptic Carleman inequality due to Bukhgeim and Uhlmann [11]. This parabolic Carleman inequality enters in an essential way in the construction of complex geometric optic (abbreviated to CGO in this text) solutions that vanish at a part of the lateral boundary and initial or final time.

A simple and high yield (up to 87%) pathway for synthesizing decyl phosphonic acid (DPA) is described. H-1 and C-13-NMR) as well as FTIR spectroscopy were used to characterize chemical structures and purity of the obtained product. Thermal properties and crystal structure of DPA were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry analysis (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The stability of DPA in Oil-in-Water (O/W) and Water-in-Oil (W/O) emulsions was improved in the presence of ammonium persulfate (APS), which allowed us to measure their specific characteristics such as particle size and zeta potential (xi) of micelles. Both emulsions were used for synthesizing polyaniline (PANI) by emulsion polymerization. Wettability of DPA on the mild steel surface was examined using contact angle measurements. Moreover, corrosion-inhibition properties studied by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique and salt spray test results revealed that DPA can be an efficient ingredient for anti-corrosion coating.

The present work is intended primarily as a demonstration of the potential offered by combination of these three instruments for studying the small-scale structure and dynamics in the lower troposphere. Here, we focus on data collected almost simultaneously by two instrumented UAVs and two meteorological balloons, near the MU radar operated continuously during the campaign. The UAVs flew along helical ascending and descending paths at a nearly constant horizontal distance from the radar (similar to 1.0 km), while the balloons launched from the MU radar site drifted up to similar to 3-5 km in the altitude range of comparisons (similar to 0.5 to 4.0 km) due to wind advection. Vertical profiles of squared Brunt-Vaisala frequency N-2 and squared vertical gradient of generalized potential refractive index M-2 were estimated at a vertical resolution of 20 m from pressure, temperature, and humidity data collected by UAVs and radiosondes. Profiles of M-2 were also estimated from MU radar echo power at vertical incidence at a vertical sampling of 20 m and various time resolutions (1-4 min). The balloons and the MU radar provided vertical profiles of wind and wind shear S so that two independent estimates of the gradient Richardson number (Ri = N-2/S-2) could be obtained at a range resolution of 150 m. The two estimates of Ri profiles also showed remarkable agreement at all altitudes. We show that all three instruments detected the same prominent temperature and humidity gradients, down to decameter scales in stratified conditions. These gradients extended horizontally over a few kilometers at least and persisted for hours without significant changes, indicating that the turbulent diffusion was weak Large discrepancies between N-2 and M-2 profiles derived from the balloon, UAV, and radar data were found in a turbulent layer generated by a Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) shear flow instability in the height range from 1.80 to 2.15 km. The cause of these discrepancies appears to depend on the stage of the KH billows.

We prove that the relaxed state process, associated with measure valued controls, is governed by an orthogonal martingale measure rather than a Brownian motion. In particular, we show by a counter example that replacing the drift and diffusion coefficient by their relaxed counterparts does not define a true relaxed control problem. We establish the existence of an optimal relaxed control, which can be approximated by a sequence of strict controls. Moreover, under some convexity conditions, we show that the optimal control is realized by a strict control.

The objective of this work is to study the arm-trunk coordination by measuring anticipatory and compensatory postural adjustments. Nine healthy subjects participated in the study after being trained in manual wheelchair. They were asked to initiate a displacement in manual wheelchair in three directions (forward vs. left vs. right), with two speeds (spontaneous vs. maximum) and with two initial hand's positions (hands on thighs vs. hands on handrails). Muscular activities in the trunk (postural component) and the arms (focal component) were recorded bilaterally. The results show two strategies for trunk control: An anticipatory adjustment strategy and a compensatory adjustment strategy with a dominance of compensation. These two strategies are influenced by the finalities of displacement in terms of speed and direction depending on the hands positions. Arm-trunk coordination is characterized by an adaptability of anticipatory and compensatory postural adjustments. The study of this type of coordination for subjects with different levels of spinal cord injury could be used to predict the forthcoming displacement and thus assist the user in a complex task.

Water wave scattering by dense or sparse arrays of surface-piercing bodies by integral matching method								APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH				75				132	142		10.1016/j.apor.2018.03.012			JUN 2018	2018	In this work, integral matching method is used for the numerical study of water wave scattering by arrays of surface-piercing structures. Such a method, already used for many years for rectangular breakwaters, is applied to structures of various shapes, including arrays of vertical cylinders, for which the contour of vertical boundaries is discretized into steps. Finite width channels of constant depth are considered, which may also correspond to uneven periodic structures along the transverse direction. Applications to sparse or dense arrays of vertical cylinders are discussed. For sparse cylinders, first order and higher order Bragg resonance are observed in both the incoming wave direction and other directions for the higher frequencies. For dense cylinders, considered as porous media, dispersion relation for the wave within the cylinders arrays is discussed through interference process due to the finite length of the porous medium (or the cylinders array) along the incoming wave direction. It is found that the wavelength slightly depends on the cylinders arrangement at given porosity and specific surface.

A Spectral Approach for Quenched Limit Theorems for Random Expanding Dynamical Systems								COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS				360	3			1121	1187		10.1007/s00220-017-3083-7			JUN 2018	2018	We prove quenched versions of (i) a large deviations principle (LDP), (ii) a central limit theorem (CLT), and (iii) a local central limit theorem for non-autonomous dynamical systems. A key advance is the extension of the spectral method, commonly used in limit laws for deterministic maps, to the general random setting. We achieve this via multiplicative ergodic theory and the development of a general framework to control the regularity of Lyapunov exponents of twisted transfer operator cocycles with respect to a twist parameter. While some versions of the LDP and CLT have previously been proved with other techniques, the local central limit theorem is, to our knowledge, a completely new result, and one that demonstrates the strength of our method. Applications include non-autonomous (piecewise) expanding maps, defined by random compositions of the form . An important aspect of our results is that we only assume ergodicity and invertibility of the random driving ; in particular no expansivity or mixing properties are required.

More recently, collaborative representation based classification (CRC) has emerged as a very powerful approach, especially for face recognition. CRC takes advantage of SRC through the notion of collaborative representation, relying on the observation that the collaborative property is more crucial for classification than the 11-norm sparsity constraint on coding coefficients used in SRC. This paper follows the same general philosophy of CRC and its main novelty is the application of a virtual collaborative projection (VCP) routine designed to train images of every class against the other classes to improve fidelity before the projection of the query image. We combine this routine with a method of local feature extraction based on high-order statistical moments to further improve the representation. We demonstrate using extensive experiments of face recognition and classification that our approach performs very competitively with respect to state-of-the-art classification methods. For instance, using the AR face dataset, our method reaches 100% of accuracy for dimensionality 300.

Unlike the case of classical linear codes, where these groups are the same, it is shown that for combinatorial codes the groups can be arbitrarily different. In particular, there exist codes with the richest possible group of isometries and the trivial group of monomial isometries. In the paper, the two groups are characterized and codes with predefined isometry groups are constructed.

The question, which has not haven straightforwardly response in the literature, needs a special consideration since the 2000s with the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement signed by Tunisia with the European Union. Applying the Hodrick and Prescott on quarterly GDP series to extract the cycles of the trend and using the method for detecting turning points Bry and Boschan developed by Harding and Pagan, it appears a transmission with a lag of one to two quarters of US economic fluctuations to European countries which then affect almost immediately Tunisian conjunctures. The synchronization of business cycles is confirmed by the use of the dynamic latent factor model initiated by Stock and Watson. However, beyond the existence of a common cycle, Tunisia faces specific movements that can also be indirectly related to its privileged relations with Europe.

It implies, inter alia, to be able to parcellate the brain volume or cortical surface into biologically relevant regions. These parcellations may be inferred from existing atlases (e.g., Desikan) or sets of rules, as would do a neuroanatomist for lobes, but also directly driven from the data (e.g., functional or structural connectivity) with minimum a priori. In the present work, we aimed at using the intrinsic geometric information contained in the eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami Operator to obtain parcellations of the cortical surface based only on its description by triangular meshes. We proposed a framework adapted from spectral clustering, which is general in scope and suitable for the co-parcellation of a group of subjects. We applied it to a dataset of 62 adults, optimized it and revealed a striking agreement between parcels produced by this unsupervised clustering and Freesurfer lobes (Desikan atlas), which cannot be explained by chance. Constituting the first reported attempt of spectral-based fully unsupervised segmentation of neuroanatomical regions such as lobes, spectral analysis of lobes (Spanol) could conveniently be fitted into a multimodal pipeline to ease, optimize or speed-up lobar or sub-lobar segmentation. In addition, we showed promising results of Spanol on smoother brains and notably on a dataset of 15 fetuses, with an interest for both the understanding of cortical ontogeny and the applicative field of perinatal computational neuroanatomy.

Electron ionization mass spectrometry fragmentation and multiple reaction monitoring quantification of bacterial metabolites of the sea ice biomarker proxy IP25 in Arctic sediments								RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY				32	10			775	783		10.1002/rcm.8101			MAY 30 2018	2018	Rationale3,9,13-Trimethyl-6-(1,5-dimethylhexyl)tetradecan-1,2-diol and 2,8,12-trimethyl-5-(1,5-dimethylhexyl)tridecanoic acid appear to be produced during the bacterial metabolism of IP25, a highly branched isoprenoid lipid often employed for past Arctic sea ice reconstruction. Characterization and quantification of these metabolites in sediments are essential to determine if bacterial degradation may exert a significant influence on IP25-based palaeo sea ice reconstructions. MethodsElectron ionization mass spectrometry (EIMS) fragmentation pathways of 3,9,13-trimethyl-6-(1,5-dimethylhexyl)tetradecan-1,2-diol and 2,8,12-trimethyl-5-(1,5-dimethylhexyl)tridecanoic acid trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives were investigated. These pathways were deduced by: (i) low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS), (ii) accurate mass measurement, and (iii) deuterium labelling. ResultsCID-MS/MS analyses, accurate mass measurement and deuterium-labelling experiments enabled us to elucidate the EIMS fragmentations of 3,9,13-trimethyl-6-(1,5-dimethylhexyl)tetradecan-1,2-diol and 2,8,12-trimethyl-5-(1,5-dimethylhexyl)tridecanoic acid TMS derivatives. Some specific fragment ions useful in addition to chromatographic retention times for further characterization could be identified. As an application of some of the described fragmentations, the TMS derivatives of these metabolites were characterized and quantified in MRM mode in different Arctic sediments. ConclusionsEIMS fragmentations of 3,9,13-trimethyl-6-(1,5-dimethylhexyl)tetradecan-1,2-diol and 2,8,12-trimethyl-5-(1,5-dimethylhexyl)tridecanoic acid TMS derivatives exhibit specific fragment ions, which appear to be very useful for the quantification of these bacterial metabolites of the palaeo tracer IP25 in sediments.

Using a rectangular Fourier filter on the blurred signal together with filtering of the lower spatial frequencies to remove the far-field contribution, the pure near-field contributions of the optical images were extracted. We performed measurements using two excitation wavelengths (532.1 nm and 632.8 nm) and two different polarizations. After the processing of the optical images, the distribution of hot spots can be correlated with the topography of the structures, as indicated by the presence of brighter spots at the apexes of the nanostructures. This technique is validated by comparison of the results to numerical simulations, where agreement is obtained, thereby confirming the near-field nature of the images. Our approach does not require any advanced equipment and we suggest that it could be applied to any type of sample, while keeping the measurement times reasonably short.

Dissolved Ra-226 and Ba are strongly correlated along the section, a pattern that may reflect their similar chemical behavior. Because Ra-226 and Ba have been widely used as tracers of water masses and ocean mixing, we investigated their behavior more thoroughly in this crucial region for thermohaline circulation, taking advantage of the contrasting biogeochemical patterns existing along the GA01 section. We used an optimum multiparameter (OMP) analysis to distinguish the relative importance of physical transport (water mass mixing) from nonconservative processes (sedimentary, river or hydrothermal inputs, uptake by particles and dissolved-particulate dynamics) on the Ra-226 and Ba distributions in the North Atlantic. Results show that the measured Ra-226 and Ba concentrations can be explained by conservative mixing for 58 and 65% of the samples, respectively, notably at intermediate depth, away from the ocean interfaces. Ra-226 and Ba can thus be considered conservative tracers of water mass transport in the ocean interior on the space scales considered here, namely, on the order of a few thousand kilometers. However, regions in which Ra-226 and Ba displayed nonconservative behavior and in some cases decoupled behaviors were also identified, mostly at the ocean boundaries (seafloor, continental margins and surface waters). Elevated Ra-226 and Ba concentrations found in deep-water in the West European Basin suggest that lower Northeast Atlantic DeepWater (NEADWl) accumulates Ra-226 and Ba from sediment diffusion and/or particle dissolution during transport. In the upper 1500m of the West European Basin, deficiencies in Ra-226 and Ba are likely explained by their incorporation in planktonic calcareous and siliceous shells, or in barite (BaSO4) by substitution or adsorption mechanisms. Finally, because Ba and Ra-226 display different source terms (mostly deep-sea sediments for Ra-226 and rivers for Ba), strong decoupling between Ra-226 and Ba were observed at the land-ocean boundaries. This is especially true in theshallow stations near the coasts of Greenland and Newfound-land where high Ra-226/Ba ratios at depth reflect the diffusion of Ra-226 from sediment and low Ra-226/Ba ratios in the upper water column reflect the input of Ba associated with meteoric waters.

Two distinct areas were considered for the MA, the western MA (WMA), and the eastern MA (EMA). The main carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) pools and fluxes provide a basis for the characterization of the expected trend from oligotrophy to ultra-oligotrophy, and the building of first-order budgets at the daily and seasonal timescales (using climatology). Sea surface chlorophyll a well reflected the expected oligotrophic gradient with higher values obtained at WMA, lower values at WGY, and intermediate values at EMA. As expected, the euphotic zone depth, the deep chlorophyll maximum, and nitracline depth deepen from west to east. Nevertheless, phosphaclines and nitraclines did not match. The decoupling between phosphacline and nitracline depths in the MA allows for excess P to be locally provided in the upper water by winter mixing. We found a significant biological "soft tissue" carbon pump in the MA sustained almost exclusively by dinitrogen (N-2) fixation and essentially controlled by phosphate availability in this iron-rich environment. The MA appears to be a net sink for atmospheric CO2, while the WGY is in quasi-steady state. We suggest that the necessary excess P, allowing the success of nitrogen fixers and subsequent carbon production and export, is mainly brought to the upper surface by local deep winter convection at an annual timescale rather than by surface circulation. While the origin of the decoupling between phosphacline and nitracline remains uncertain, the direct link between local P upper water enrichment, N-2 fixation, and organic carbon production and export, offers a possible shorter timescale than previously thought between N input by N-2 fixation and carbon export. The low iron availability in the SP gyre and P availability in the MA during the stratified period may appear as the ultimate control of N input by N-2 fixation. Because of the huge volume of water to consider, and because the SP Ocean is the place of intense denitrification in the east (N sink) and N-2 fixation in the west (N source), precise seasonal C, N, P, and iron (Fe) budgets would be of prime interest to understand the efficiency, at the present time and in the future, of the oceanic biological carbon pump.

Despite the morphology of several Oithona species is well known, knowledge of its internal anatomy and chitin distribution is still limited. To answer this problem, Oithona nana and O. similis individuals were stained by Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Fluorescein IsoThioCyanate (WGA-FITC) and DiAmidino-2-PhenylIndole (DAPI) for fluorescence microscopy observations. The image analyses allowed a new description of the organization and chitin content of the digestive and reproductive systems of Oithona male and female. Chitin microfibrils were found all along the digestive system from the stomach to the hindgut with a higher concentration at the peritrophic membrane of the anterior midgut. Several midgut shrinkages were observed and proposed to be involved in faecal pellet shaping and motion. Amorphous chitin structures were also found to be a major component of the ducts and seminal vesicles and receptacles. The rapid staining protocol we proposed allowed a new insight into the Oithona internal anatomy and highlighted the role of chitin in the digestion and reproduction. This method could be applied to a wide range of copepods in order to perform comparative anatomy analyses.

We report for the first time an organocatalytic scanning probe nanolithography (o-cSPL) approach. Covalent binding of an organocatalyst on the apex of an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip gives way to a system that allows the formation of locally defined acylated-alcohol patterns on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). With resolutions comparable to those of other cSPL methods, this first example of o-cSPL holds promise for future applications of bottom-up nanolithography set-ups employing this novel technique.

J	Genois, Mathieu; Barrat, Alain								Can co-location be used as a proxy for face-to-face contacts?								EPJ DATA SCIENCE				7						11	10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0140-1			MAY 8 2018	2018	Technological advances have led to a strong increase in the number of data collection efforts aimed at measuring co-presence of individuals at different spatial resolutions. It is however unclear how much co-presence data can inform us on actual face-to-face contacts, of particular interest to study the structure of a population in social groups or for use in data-driven models of information or epidemic spreading processes. Here, we address this issue by leveraging data sets containing high resolution face-to-face contacts as well as a coarser spatial localisation of individuals, both temporally resolved, in various contexts. The co-presence and the face-to-face contact temporal networks share a number of structural and statistical features, but the former is (by definition) much denser than the latter. We thus consider several down-sampling methods that generate surrogate contact networks from the co-presence signal and compare them with the real face-to-face data. We show that these surrogate networks reproduce some features of the real data but are only partially able to identify the most central nodes of the face-to-face network. We then address the issue of using such down-sampled co-presence data in data-driven simulations of epidemic processes, and in identifying efficient containment strategies. We show that the performance of the various sampling methods strongly varies depending on context. We discuss the consequences of our results with respect to data collection strategies and methodologies.

Using a Lagrangian strategy, we sampled the same water mass for the entire duration of each long-duration (5 days) station, allowing us to consider only vertical exchanges for the budgets. We quantified all major vertical N fluxes both entering (N-2 fixation, nitrate turbulent diffusion, atmospheric deposition) and leaving the photic layer (particulate N export). The three stations were characterized by a strong nitracline and contrasted deep chlorophyll maximum depths, which were lower in the oligotrophic Melanesian archipelago (MA, stations LD A and LD B) than in the ultra-oligotrophic waters of the South Pacific Gyre (SPG, station LD C). N-2 fixation rates were extremely high at both LD A (593 +/- 51 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1)) and LD B (706 +/- 302 mu mol N m(-2)d(-1)), and the diazotroph community was dominated by Trichodesmium. N-2 fixation rates were lower (59 +/- 16 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1)) at LD C, and the diazotroph community was dominated by unicellular N-2-fixing cyanobacteria (UCYN). At all stations, N-2 fixation was the major source of new N (> 90 %) before atmospheric deposition and upward nitrate fluxes induced by turbulence. N-2 fixation contributed circa 1318 % of primary production in the MA region and 3 in the SPG water and sustained nearly all new primary production at all stations. The e ratio (e ratio articulate carbon export / primary production) was maximum at LD A (9.7 ) and was higher than the e ratio in most studied oligotrophic regions (< 5), indicating a high efficiency of the WTSP to export carbon relative to primary production. The direct export of diazotrophs assessed by qPCR of the nifH gene in sediment traps represented up to 30.6 of the PC export at LD A, while their contribution was 5 and < 0.1 % at LD B and LD C, respectively. At the three studied stations, the sum of all N input to the photic layer exceeded the N output through organic matter export. This disequilibrium leading to N accumulation in the upper layer appears as a characteristic of the WTSP during the summer season.

However, it is unclear when and where the numerous viral particles we observe in the sea are produced and whether they are active. To address these questions, we performed time-series analyses of viral metagenomes and microbial metatranscriptomes collected over a period of 24 h at a Japanese coastal site. Through mapping the metatranscriptomic reads on three sets of viral genomes ((i) 878 contigs of Osaka Bay viromes (OBV), (ii) 1766 environmental viral genomes from marine viromes, and (iii) 2429 reference viral genomes), we revealed that all the local OBV contigs were transcribed in the host fraction. This indicates that the majority of viral populations detected in viromes are active, and suggests that virions are rapidly diluted as a result of diffusion, currents, and mixing. Our data further revealed a peak of cyanophage gene expression in the afternoon/dusk followed by an increase of genomes from their virions at night and less-coherent infectious patterns for viruses putatively infecting various groups of heterotrophs. This suggests that cyanophages drive the diel release of cyanobacteria-derived organic matter into the environment and viruses of heterotrophic bacteria might have adapted to the population-specific life cycles of hosts.

Upon short-term salinity shift, denitrification rate and denitrifiers abundance showed high resistance whatever the sediment origin is. Denitrifying community adapted to frequent salinity changes showed high resistance when salinity increases, with a dynamic nosZ relative expression level. Marine sediment denitrifying community, characterized by more stable pattern, was less resistant when salinity decreases. However, after two successive variations of salinity, it shifted toward the characteristic community of fluctuating conditions, with larger proportion of Pseudomonas-nosZ, exhibiting an increase of nosZ relative expression level. The impact of long-term salinity variation upon bacterial community was confirmed at ribosomal level with a higher percentage of Pseudomonas and lower proportion of nosZII Glade genera.

The technique of Mellin-Barnes approximants (MBa) that we propose is illustrated in detail with the example of the two loop vacuum polarization function in QED. We then apply it to the first few moments of the hadronic spectral function obtained from experiment and show that the resulting MB a evaluations of alpha(HVP)(mu) converge very quickly to the full experimental determination.

In this work, we examined the influence of the III-V material surface cleaning and the semiconductor growth technique on the electrical properties of metal/Al2O3/In0.53Ga0.47As capacitors grown on InP(100) substrates. By means of the capacitance-voltage measurements, we demonstrated that samples do not have the same total oxide charge density depending on the cleaning solution used [(NH4)(2)S or NH4OH] prior to oxide deposition. The determination of the interface trap density revealed that a Fermi-level pinning occurs for samples grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition but not for similar samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Deep level transient spectroscopy analysis explained the Fermi-level pinning by an additional signal for samples grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, attributed to the tunneling effect of carriers trapped in oxide toward interface states. This work emphasizes that the choice of appropriate oxide and cleaning treatment is not enough to prevent a Fermi-level pinning in III-V metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors. The semiconductor growth technique needs to be taken into account because it impacts the trapping properties of the oxide. Published by AIP Publishing.

Self-diffusion in single crystalline silicon nanowires								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				123	16					161515	10.1063/1.4996987			APR 28 2018	2018	Self-diffusion experiments in single crystalline isotopically controlled silicon nanowires with diameters of 70 and 400 nm at 850 and 1000 degrees C are reported. The isotope structures were first epitaxially grown on top of silicon substrate wafers. Nanowires were subsequently fabricated using a nanosphere lithography process in combination with inductively coupled plasma dry reactive ion etching. Three-dimensional profiling of the nanosized structure before and after diffusion annealing was performed by means of atom probe tomography (APT). Self-diffusion profiles obtained from APT analyses are accurately described by Fick's law for self-diffusion. Data obtained for silicon self-diffusion in nanowires are equal to the results reported for bulk silicon crystals, i.e., finite size effects and high surface-to-volume ratios do not significantly affect silicon self-diffusion. This shows that the properties of native point defects determined from self-diffusion in bulk crystals also hold for nanosized silicon structures with diameters down to 70 nm.

We focused on episodic situations characterized by a coastal circulation pattern induced by intrusion events of the Northern Current (NC) on the continental shelf, associated with SE wind regimes. We computed, using MARS3D-RHOMA and ICHTHYOP models, the particle trajectories from a patch of 5.10(4) passive and conservative fine particles released at the WWTP outlet, during 2 chosen representative periods of intrusion of the NC in June 2008 and in October 2011, associated with S-SE and E-SE winds, respectively. Unexpected results highlighted that the amount of particles reaching the vulnerable shorelines of both northern and southern bays accounted for 21.2% and 46.3% of the WWTP initial patch, in June 2008 and October 2011, respectively. Finally, a conceptual diagram is proposed to highlight the mechanisms of dispersion within the bays of Marseille of the fine particles released at the WWTP outlet that have long been underestimated.

Since few years we develop an approach based on addressable electroactive coatings containing conducting polymers or polymers with lateral redox groups. In this article we describe the use of a screen-printed plate formed by 96 three-electrode electrochemical cells to assess the potential of these electroactive coatings to prevent the adhesion of marine bacteria. This novel platform is intended to control and record the redox properties of the electroactive coating in each well during the bioassay (15 h) and to allow screening its antiadhesion activity with enough replicates to support significant conclusions. Validation of this platform was carried out with poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as electroactive coating obtained by electropolymerization of EDOT monomer in artificial seawater electrolyte on the working electrode of each electrochemical cell of the 96-well microplate.

In particular, single and two-photon squeezing as well as entanglement in the frequency domain have been reported. By revising the photoassisted noise analysis developed in the framework of electron quantum optics, we present a detailed comparison between the cosine drive case and other experimentally relevant periodic voltages such as rectangular and Lorentzian pulses. We show that the latter drive is the best candidate in order to enhance quantum features and purity of the outgoing single and two-photon states, a noteworthy result in a quantum information perspective.

We show that this classical memory is accompanied by a supertranslation quantum memory that modulates the entanglement between the opposing Rindler wedges in quantum field theory. A corresponding phenomenon across a black hole horizon may play a role in Hawking, Perry, and Strominger's proposal for supertranslations to provide a solution to the black hole information paradox.y		[Kolekar, Sanved; Louko, Jorma] Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Kolekar, Sanved] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CPT,UMR 7332, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Kolekar, Sanved] UM DAE Ctr Excellence Basic Sci, Bombay 400098, Maharashtra, India; [Kolekar, Sanved] Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Kolekar, Sanved] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CPT,UMR 7332, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Kolekar, Sanved] UM DAE Ctr Excellence Basic Sci, Bombay 400098, Maharashtra, India								3							Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics, Particles & Fields	WOS:000430061300015

Seawater samples were collected monthly from December 2013 to November 2014 in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Marseille Bay). The samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as well as the molecular distribution of dissolved PAEs by using solid phase extraction followed by gas chromatography andmass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses. The results demonstrated the occurrence of six PAEs, including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), with total concentrations ranging from 130 to 1330 ng L-1 (av. 522 ng L-1). In Marseille Bay, the highest concentrations were detected in the bottom water from June to November 2014 and in the whole water column during the winter mixing period. This result suggests that resuspension of PAErich sediment, in relation to the accumulation of plastic debris above the seabed, or the higher degradation rate in the upper layer of the water column, plays a significant role in the PAE dynamics in coastal water. DEHP was the most abundant PAE in all of the surface samples and the summer bottom samples, followed by DiBP and DnBP, which also represent the largest fractions in the other bottom samples.

The devices are designed and simulated using a quantum transport model based on the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism and a 6-band k. p Hamiltonian. We experimentally observe significant improvements of the peak tunneling current density on both heterostructures with a 460-fold increase for a moderately doped GaAs TJ when the InGaAs QW is inserted at the junction interface, and a 3-fold improvement on a highly doped GaAs TJ integrating a type II InGaAs/GaAsSb QW. Thus, the simple insertion of staggered band lineup heterostructures enables us to reach a tunneling current well above the kA cm(-2) range, equivalent to the best achieved results for Si-doped GaAs TJs, implying very interesting potential for TJ-based components, such as multi-junction solar cells, vertical cavity surface emitting lasers and tunnel-field effect transistors.

The compound was analyzed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDS). The diffraction profiles showed a highly crystallized sample with dimensions of 3 mu m. Rietveld refinement confirmed the pure monoclinic C2/c zinc phosphate phase. The SEM images showed platelet faceted morphology with different orientations and a crystal growth mechanism has been proposed. The photocatalytic experiments were carried out using Rhodamine B (RhB) as a model pollutant; the UV-visible spectrometry was used to analyze the evolution of dye degradation. The obtained experimental results showed that the Rhodamine B dye degradation efficiency is significantly dependent on different physico-chemical conditions including catalyst loading, pH and dye concentration. Furthermore, the zinc phosphate photocatalyst was found to be fairly photostable during four regeneration cycles. Finally, a photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the active species trapping experiments.

The structural properties reveal the coexistence of both ferroelectric (P4mm) and antiferroelectric (P4bm) tetragonal phases for the lanthanum-free system. Nonetheless, for the La3+ modified samples, both antiferroelectric tetragonal (P4bm) and ferroelectric rhombohedral (R3c) phases coexist. On the other hand, slim-like hysteresis loops for the x =1 at.% La3+ concentration have been observed, suggesting a higher stability of the antiferroelectric phase. However, for the other compositions (including the lanthanum-free sample) the P-E hysteresis loops suggested a higher stability of the ferroelectric phase. The dielectric response has shown the presence of three anomalies in the entire analyzed temperature range, which have been associated to different phase transitions with an important influence of the lanthanum content.

New FRB discoveries and their follow-up								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				475	2			1427	1446		10.1093/mnras/stx3074			APR 2018	2018	We report the discovery of four Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in the ongoing SUrvey for Pulsars and Extragalactic Radio Bursts at the Parkes Radio Telescope: FRBs 150610, 151206, 151230 and 160102. Our real-time discoveries have enabled us to conduct extensive, rapid multimessenger follow-up at 12 major facilities sensitive to radio, optical, X-ray, gamma-ray photons and neutrinos on time-scales ranging from an hour to a few months post-burst. No counterparts to the FRBs were found and we provide upper limits on afterglow luminosities. None of the FRBs were seen to repeat. Formal fits to all FRBs show hints of scattering while their intrinsic widths are unresolved in time. FRB 151206 is at low Galactic latitude, FRB 151230 shows a sharp spectral cut-off, and FRB 160102 has the highest dispersion measure (DM = 2596.1 +/- 0.3 pc cm(-3)) detected to date. Three of the FRBs have high dispersion measures (DM > 1500 pc cm(-3)), favouring a scenario where the DMis dominated by contributions from the intergalactic medium. The slope of the Parkes FRB source counts distribution with fluences > 2 Jy ms is alpha = - 2.2(-1.2)(+0.6) and still consistent with a Euclidean distribution (alpha = -3/2). We also find that the all-sky rate is 1.7(-0.9)(+1.5) x 10(3)FRBs/(4 pi sr)/day above similar to 2 Jy ms and there is currently no strong evidence for a latitude- dependent FRB sky rate.

J	Passot, T.; Sulem, P. L.; Tassi, E.								Gyrofluid modeling and phenomenology of low-beta(e) Alfven wave turbulence								PHYSICS OF PLASMAS				25	4					042107	10.1063/1.5022528			APR 2018	2018	A two-field reduced gyrofluid model including electron inertia, ion finite Larmor radius corrections, and parallel magnetic field fluctuations is derived from the model of Brizard [Brizard, Phys. Fluids B 4, 1213 (1992)]. It assumes low beta(e), where beta(e) indicates the ratio between the equilibrium electron pressure and the magnetic pressure exerted by a strong uniform magnetic guide field, but permits an arbitrary ion-to-electron equilibrium temperature ratio. It is shown to have a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure and provides a convenient framework for studying kinetic Alfven wave turbulence, from magnetohydrodynamics to sub-d(e) scales (where d(e) holds for the electron skin depth). Magnetic energy spectra are phenomenologically determined within energy and generalized cross-helicity cascades in the perpendicular spectral plane. Arguments based on absolute statistical equilibria are used to predict the direction of the transfers, pointing out that, within the sub-ion range, the generalized cross-helicity could display an inverse cascade if injected at small scales, for example by reconnection processes.

We apply aerosol deposition fields simulated from atmospheric models into the high resolution oceanic bio-geochemical model NEMOMED12/PISCES with nutrient ratios used for plankton growth set to Redfield ratio. We perform 3 simulations to determine the impact of nutrients on productivity over the period 1997-2012: (i) without atmospheric deposition, (ii) with nitrogen deposition from anthropogenic and natural sources, and (iii) with deposition of both nitrogen (from anthropogenic and natural sources) and phosphate from desert dust. Time series of modeled deposition fluxes are compared to available measurements. This comparison with measurements shows that both variability and intensity ranges are realistic enough for our main purpose of estimating the atmospheric deposition impact on Mediterranean biogeochemical tracers such as surface nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a and plankton concentrations. Our results show that atmospheric deposition is one of the major sources of nitrogen and phosphorus for some regions of the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea. More than 18.10(9)gN month(-1) are deposited to the whole Mediterranean Sea. This deposition is responsible for an average increase of 30-50% in primary production over vast regions. Natural dust-derived deposition of phosphorus is sparser in space and time (0.5.10(9) g month(-1) on average over the entire basin). However, dust deposition events can significantly affect biological production. We calculate fertilizing effects of phosphate from dust to be low on average (6-10%) but up to 30% increase in primary productivity can be observed during the months when surface water stratification occurs. Finally, these fertilizing effects are shown to be transmitted along the biological chain (primary production, Chl a, phytoplankton, zooplankton, grazing). We also perform a preliminary study on the maximal biological response of the Mediterranean by simulating extreme deposition events throughout the basin over a full year period. We show that nitrogen deposition effects observed in our long-term simulations (1997-2012) are close to maximal effects (i.e. those produced by high intensity deposition events) whereas dust-derived phosphate effects are substantially weaker than the effect on productivity reached when an extreme deposition event occurs.

J	Ribeiro Pereira, Osvaldo Jos; Melfi, Adolpho Jose; Montes, Celia Regina; Lucas, Yves								Downscaling of ASTER Thermal Images Based on Geographically Weighted Regression Kriging								REMOTE SENSING				10	4					633	10.3390/rs10040633			APR 2018	2018	The lower spatial resolution of thermal infrared (TIR) satellite images and derived land surface temperature (LST) is one of the biggest challenges in mapping temperature at a detailed map scale. An extensive range of scientific and environmental applications depend on the availability of fine spatial resolution temperature data. All satellite-based sensor systems that are equipped with a TIR detector depict a spatial resolution that is coarser than most of the multispectral bands of the same system. Certain studies may therefore be not feasible if applied in areas that depict a high spatial variation in temperature at small spatial scales, such as urban centers and flooded pristine areas. To solve this problem, this study applied an image downscaling method to enhance the spatial resolution of LST data by combining TIR, multispectral images, and derived data, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), according to the geographically weighted regression (GWRK) and area-to-point kriging of regressed residuals. The resulting LST images of the natural and anthropogenic urban areas of the Brazilian Pantanal are very highly correlated to the reference LST images. The approach, combining ASTER TIR with ASTER visible/infrared (VNIR) and Sentinel-2 images according to the GWRK method, performed better than all of the remaining state-of-the-art downscaling methods.

When the clams were exposed to dissolved metals, Co, Zn, and Ag were readily incorporated in their tissues (concentration factors (CF) ranging from 181 to 4982 after 28 days of exposure) and all metals were strongly retained (biological half-lives always > 2 months). The estimated transfer factor (TF) in clam tissues after a 35-day sediment exposure was 1 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than the estimated CF, indicating a lower bioavailability of sediment-bound metals than dissolved ones. Once incorporated, metals taken up from sediment and seawater were retained longer than metals ingested with food, indicating that the uptake pathway influences the storage processes of metals in clam tissues. Compilation of our data into a global bioaccumulation model indicated that, except for Ag that essentially originated from food (92%), sediment was the main source of metal bioaccumulation in the clam (more than 80%). These results highlight that bioaccumulation processes strongly depend from one metal to the other. The overall efficient bioaccumulation and retention capacities of the clam G. pectinatum confirm its usefulness as a bioindicator species that can provide time-integrated information about ambient contamination levels in the tropical marine coastal environment.

Dissolved P, especially in organic form, is dominant during the wet season, while higher insoluble P fluxes are recorded during the dry period, mainly due to dust outbreaks. Wet deposition has a significant contribution to the atmospheric phosphorus flux; over the NW Mediterranean accounting for 80% of the total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). The seven-year average TDP flux during the wet season in the NW basin, of 1.78 mmol m(-2) y(-1), is almost double that of the two-year average in the eastern Mediterranean. The difference is attributed mainly to the precipitation height being 2-3 times higher in the NW Mediterranean compared to the East. Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) is the dominant P fraction in both wet and dry deposition samples, presenting similar fluxes (1.16 and 0.94 mmol m(-2) y(-1), in the eastern and north-western basins respectively). Finally, assuming that all TDP is bioavailable, atmospheric deposition of TDP could account for up to 38% of new production in the eastern Mediterranean, while during oligotrophic periods of the NW Mediterranean it could increase the new production by 14%.

Atmospheric fluxes of soluble organic C, N, and P to the Mediterranean Sea: Potential biogeochemical implications in the surface layer								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				163				59	69		10.1016/j.pocean.2017.07.008			APR 2018	2018	Linking atmospheric deposition to marine carbon and nutrient cycle is hampered by the lack of data on atmospheric fluxes of organic matter. To fill this gap, this study reports the first quantification of atmospheric fluxes of soluble organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (SON) and phosphate (SOP) to the NW Mediterranean Sea. Simultaneous measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphate (DOP) in the surface mixed layer (SML) allowed estimating the potential contribution of atmospheric fluxes to marine DOC, DON and DOP inventories. We found an annual atmospheric flux of 59 mmol Cm-2 year(-1) for SOC, 16.4 mmol N m(-2) year(-1) for SON and 23.6 mu mol P m(-2) year(-1) for SOP, with proportions of SON and SOP to total soluble nitrogen and phosphate of 40% and 25%, respectively. Assuming these annual fluxes valid for the entire western Mediterranean basin, atmospheric fluxes would be higher than DOC, DON and DOP fluxes from the Rhone River by a factor of 6, 17 and 2, for C, N and P, respectively. Inventories of DOC, DON and DOP in the surface mixed layer displayed similar trends over the study period with maximum values at the end of the stratification period. DOP contributed by 85 +/- 11% to total dissolved phosphate (TDP) pool and exhibited a labile fraction (LOOP) of 27 +/- 19%. The contribution of atmospheric deposition to the DOC, DON and DOP pools in the SML, estimated for the stratification period, was low for C (3%) and P (4.5%) and moderate for N (12%). The labile fraction of atmospheric SOP (LSOP) was quantified throughout the sampling period and showed a high variability ranging from 0 to 97%. Atmospheric fluxes of LSOP contributed by 7% to marine LDOP pool and could sustain up to 8% of the heterotrophic prokaryotic phosphate demand in the SML of the NW Mediterranean Sea during the stratification period. The results obtained in this study stress the need to include atmospheric fluxes of organic matter in marine biogeochemical models to achieve a more complete picture of carbon and nutrient cycle in the Mediterranean Sea.

Sugars in atmospheric aerosols over the Eastern Mediterranean								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				163				70	81		10.1016/j.pocean.2017.09.001			APR 2018	2018	Aerosol samples (PM10) were collected at Finokalia monitoring station in a remote area of Crete in the Eastern Mediterranean over a two-year period. They were analyzed for total organic carbon (OC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and the molecular distribution of sugars. WSOC comprised 45% of OC while the contribution of sugars to the OC and WSOC content in the PM10 particles averaged 3 +/- 2% (n = 218) and 11 +/- 6% (n = 132), respectively. The total concentration of sugars ranged between 6 and 334 ng m(-3) with the two most abundant sugars over the two-year period being glucose and levoglucosan, contributing about 25% each to the total carbohydrate pool. Primary saccharides (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) peaked at the beginning of spring (21, 17, and 15 ng m(-3), respectively), indicating significant contributions of bioaerosols to the total organic aerosol mass. On the other hand, higher concentrations of anhydrosugars (biomass burning tracers levoglucosan, mannosan, galactosan) were recorded in winter (19, 1.4, and 0.2 ng m(-3) respectively) than in summer (9.1, 1.1, and 0.5 ng m(-3) respectively). Levoglucosan was the dominant monosaccharide in winter (37% of total sugars) while the low concentration measured in summer (19% of total sugars) was probably due to the enhanced photochemical oxidation by hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) radicals which impact anhydrosugars. Based on levoglucosan observations, biomass burning was estimated to contribute up to 13% to the annual average OC measured at Finokalia. Annual OC, WSOC, and carbohydrate dry deposition fluxes for the two-year sampling period were estimated at 414, 175, and 9 mg C m(-2) y(-1), respectively. Glucose and levoglucosan accounted for 34% and 2% of the total sugar fluxes. According to our estimations, atmospheric OC and WSOC inputs account for 0.70% and 0.71%, respectively of the carbon in the annual primary production in the Cretan Sea. Considering the entire Mediterranean, dry deposition of OC can provide at least 3 times more C than riverine inputs of Rhone. Carbohydrate dry deposition flux represents a small fraction of total carbon flux up to 0.04% of the C used for the primary production in the Cretan Sea, while this value is < 0.01% for the entire Mediterranean. OC and WSOC contributions are in the order of 0.33% and 0.14% for the whole Mediterranean basin and further underline a minor contribution of the atmosphere in the carbon cycle of the Mediterranean Sea.

The maxima of suitable observables sampled along the trajectory of a chaotic dynamical system converge asymptotically to classical extreme value laws where: (i) the inverse of the scale parameter gives the correlation dimension and (ii) the extremal index is associated with the rate of phase space contraction for backward iteration, which in dimension 1 and 2, is closely related to the positive Lyapunov exponent and in higher dimensions is related to the metric entropy. We call it the Dynamical Extremal Index. Numerical estimates are straightforward to obtain as they imply just a simple fit to a univariate distribution. Numerical tests range from low dimensional maps, to generalized Henon maps and climate data. The estimates of the indicators are particularly robust even with relatively short time series.

Given the need to identify reliable non-invasive solutions for core temperature ambulatory monitoring, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of zero-heat-flux (ZHF) temperature sensor on the forehead (T-COzhf) by comparing it with intestinal temperature (T-COpill) in different ambient and physiological conditions. Methods. Seven trained male subjects were followed during a 45-min rest period (STA) and a 25-min self-regulated cycling exercise performed in neutral (TMP. 22.8 degrees C) and hot (HOT, 38.5 degrees C) ambient temperature. Results. T-COzhf values differed from T-COpill of -0.23 +/- 0.13 in STA, 0.15 +/- 0.30 degrees C in TMP and 0.28 +/- 0.38 degrees C in HOT. The 95% limits of agreement showed an acceptable bias between T-COzhf and T-COpill in STA (+/- 0.26 degrees C), but not in TMP and HOT (+/- 0.60 and +/- 0.75 degrees C). Conclusion. The non-invasive ZHF sensor gave an accurate estimation of T-COpill in steady state but not during exercise. However, complementary results let suppose that ZHF performance is not affected by ambient conditions and could be a relevant alternative for deep body temperature measurement during whole -body heat stress.

LDP relies on local derivative direction variations to capture local patterns contained in an image region. Our proposed local descriptor combines different directional LDPs computed from three depth maps obtained by representing depth sequences in three orthogonal views and is able to jointly encode the shape and motion cues. Moreover, we suggest the use of Sparse Coding-based Fisher Vector (SCFVC) for encoding local descriptors into a global representation of depth sequences. SCFVC has been proven effective for object recognition but has not gained much attention for action recognition. We perform action recognition using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

This is done by the detection of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operated near the radar during the Shigaraki UAV radar experiment campaign, carried out from June 1, 2015 to June 14, 2015. During this campaign devoted to the measurements of fine-scale turbulence and stability in the lower troposphere using the turbulence sensors on the DataHawk UAV and the MU radar, the detection of the small UAV by the MU radar provided an excellent opportunity for taking stock of the range imaging technique in the presence of a single hard target. It was found that range imaging reproduces a faithful image of the aircraft position and its displacements with an excellent accuracy (of the order of similar to 10 m), giving extra credence to the thin echo layers and their vertical displacements generally observed from the range imaging technique in stably stratified conditions.

We show that several graph polynomials from the literature arise from this framework. These polynomials include the classical Tutte polynomial of graphs and matroids, Las Vergnas' Tutte polynomial of the morphism of matroids and his Tutte polynomial for embedded graphs, Bollobas and Riordan's ribbon graph polynomial, the Krushkal polynomial, and the Penrose polynomial. We show that our Tutte polynomials of Hopf algebras share common properties with the classical Tutte polynomial, including deletion-contraction definitions, universality properties, convolution formulas, and duality relations. New results for graph polynomials from the literature are then obtained as examples of the general results. Our results offer a framework for the study of the Tutte polynomial and its analogues in other settings, offering the means to determine the properties and connections between a wide class of polynomial invariants.

JEVD notably occurs in source separation problems and for the canonical polyadic decomposition of tensors. Most of the existing JEVD algorithms are based on a block coordinate procedure and require significant modifications to deal with complex-valued matrices. These modifications decrease algorithms performances either in terms of estimation accuracy of the eigenvectors or in terms of computational cost. Therefore, we propose a class of algorithms working equally with real- or complex-valued matrices. These algorithms are still based on a block coordinate procedure and multiplicative updates. The originality of the proposed approach lies in the structure of the updating matrix and in the way the optimization problem is solved in C-NxN. That structure is parametrized and allows to define up to five different JEVD algorithms. Thanks to numerical simulations, we show that, with respect to the more accurate algorithms of the literature, this approach improves the estimation of the eigenvectors and has a computational cost significantly lower. Finally, as an application example, one of the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to the blind source separation of Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access signals.

Kinetics of polymerization show that the monomers react in a near-linear manner during the early hours and the consumption of silyl monomers is faster than MDO. The silyl ester side groups in the copolymers are prone to hydrolysis on contact with artificial seawater (ASW), leading to a decrease of the water contact angle of the copolymer film with immersion time. The nature of the silyl ester groups was shown to be able to tune the hydrolysis rate of the copolymers and the hydrophilicity of polymer films. The hydrolysis rates of MATM2 and TBSiMA are faster than the TIPSiMA one. The water uptake test shows that copolymers containing MATM2 and TBSiMA have higher water absorption than the copolymer based on TIPSiMA. MDO copolymers with MATM2 and TBSiMA show a significant decline in molar mass by 90% and 86% after immersion in ASW at room temperature for 7 weeks, mainly due to the cleavage of main-chain ester bonds. Their degradation is accelerated at 60 degrees C; meanwhile the TIPSiMA-based polyester does not show notable degradation at both temperatures, indicating that the hydrolytic degradation rate of the polymer backbone is tuned by the amount of hydrolyzed ester side groups.

In sediments collected on a transect along a river plume, the authigenic accumulation of these redox-sensitive elements appears to be linked to sediment grain size which probably drives the redox status of the sediments. A typical U loss in re-oxidized sediments was observed in sediments that had been previously disturbed. However, the dissolved U profiles do not show a simple and typical depletion trend but rather a depletion in the top 10 cm followed by release in deeper pore waters that could be linked to a potential reoxidation/mobilization of authigenic U(IV). The released U could be further scavenged as a U-P precipitate. The U isotopic data (delta U-238), which are the first reported for the coastal hypoxic sediments of Toulon Bay, average -0.12 +/- 0.12% in surface sediments. However, sediments situated in front of river mouths show higher values of delta U-238 (up to +0.75%); these high values are reported for the first time in sediments below an oxic water column.

It has been demonstrated that thin films, deposited with the sputtering technique, are amorphous and can be crystallized with appropriate heat treatment. The thin film glass-ceramic behaves as a p-type semiconductor, even if it contains p-type Cu2GeSe3 and n-type Sb2Se3. The conductivity of Sb2Se3 has been greatly improved by appropriate iodine doping. The first photovoltaic solar cells based on the association of iodine-doped Sb2Se3 and the glass-ceramic thin films give a short-circuit current density J(SC) of 10 mA/cm(2) and an open-circuit voltage V-OC of 255 mV, with a power conversion efficiency of about 0.9%.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the applicability of this powerful technique combined with Steady-State (S-S) measurements. A multi-mode factor analysis, in particular CP/PARAFAC, was used to analyze the interaction between Europium (Eu) and Humic substances (HSs) extracted from Saint Lawrence Estuary in Canada. The Saint Lawrence system is a semi-enclosed water stream with connections to the Atlantic Ocean and is an excellent natural laboratory. CP/PARAFAC applied to fluorescence S-S data allows introspecting ligands metal interactions and the one-site 1:1 modeling gives information about the stability constants. From the spectral signatures and decay lifetimes data given by TRLFS, one can deduce the fluorescence quenching which modifies the fluorescence and discuss its mechanisms. Results indicated a relatively strong binding ability between europium and humic substances samples (Log K value varies from 3.38 to 5.08 at pH 7.00). Using the Stern-Volmer plot, it has been concluded that static and dynamic quenching takes places in the case of salicylic acid and europium interaction while for HSs interaction only a static quenching is observed.

Crystallographic orientation of facets and planar defects in functional nanostructures elucidated by nano-focused coherent diffractive X-ray imaging								NANOSCALE				10	10			4833	4840		10.1039/c7nr07990g			MAR 14 2018	2018	The physical and chemical properties of nanostructures depend on their surface facets. Here, we exploit a pole figure approach to determine the three-dimensional orientation matrix of a nanostructure from a single Bragg reflection measured with a coherent nano-focused X-ray beam. The signature of any truncated (faceted) crystal produces a crystal truncation rod, which corresponds to a streak of intensity in reciprocal space normal to the surface. When two or more non-parallel facets are present, both the crystal orientation and the crystal facets can be identified. This enables facets to be rapidly indexed and uncommon facets, and planar defects, that have been difficult to study before to be identified. We demonstrate the technique with (i) epitaxial core-shell InGaN/GaN multiple quantum-wells grown on GaN nanowires, where surface facets and planar defects are determined, and (ii) single randomly oriented highly faceted tetrahedrahexal Pt nanoparticles. The methodology is applicable to a broad range of nanocrystals and provides a unique insight into the connection between structure and properties of nanomaterials.

However, some obese subjects with autonomic imbalance present a dissociation between sympathetic activity-mediated vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Here, we aimed to determine in a rat model of metabolic syndrome whether the endothelium endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS)-NO pathway contributes to counteract the vasopressor effect of the sympathetic system. Rats were fed a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet for 15 wk. Sympathovagal balance was evaluated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability and plasmatic catecholamine measurements. Blood pressure was measured in the presence or absence of N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to inhibit the contribution of eNOS. Vascular reactivity was assessed on isolated aortic rings in response to alpha(1)-adrenergic agonist. The HFS diet increased sympathetic tone, which is characterized by a higher low on the high-frequency spectral power ratio and a higher plasmatic concentration of epinephrine. Despite this, no change in blood pressure was observed. Interestingly, HFS rats exhibited vascular hyporeactivity (-23.6%) to alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor stimulation that was abolished by endothelial removal or eNOS inhibition (L-NAME). In addition, eNOS phosphorylation (Ser(1177)) was increased in response to phenylephrine in HFS rats only. Accordingly, eNOS inhibition in vivo revealed higher blood pressure in HFS rats compared with control rats (147 vs. 126 mmHg for mean blood pressure, respectively). Restrain of adrenergic vasopressor action by endothelium eNOS is increased in HFS rats and contributes to maintained blood pressure in the physiological range. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Despite the fact that prohypertensive sympathetic nervous system activity is markedly increased in rats with early metabolic syndrome, they present with normal blood pressure. These observations appear to be explained by increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase response to adrenergic stimulation, which results in vascular hyporeactivity to alpha-adrenergic stimulation, and therefore blood pressure is preserved in the physiological range.

PCB budgets and fluxes between the different species of PCB: dissolved, particulate, biosorbed on plankton, assimilated by zooplankton, which are governed by different processes: adsorption/desorption, bacteria and plankton mortality, zooplankton excretion, grazing, mineralization, volatilization have been estimated. Model outputs were compared with the available in situ data. It was found that the Rhone River outflows play an important role in the organism contamination in the coastal zone, whereas the atmospheric depositions are rather more important in the offshore zones. The transfer of the available contaminant to bacteria and phytoplankton species is mainly related to the biomass present in the water column. Absorption fluxes (grazing) to zooplankton are rather higher than the passive sorption fluxes, which are themselves also linked to the sorption coefficient.

Formulas for the decomposition of tensor products of any simple and projective U(q)sl(2 vertical bar 1)-module with the generating modules 3 and ($) over bar3 are obtained. The centralizer of U(q)sl(2 vertical bar 1) on the mixed tensor product is calculated. It is shown to be the quotient X-m,X-n of the quantum walled Brauer algebra qwB(m,n). The structure of projective modules over X-m,X-n is written down explicitly. It is known that the walled Brauer algebras form an infinite tower. We have calculated the corresponding restriction functors on simple and projective modules over X-m,X-n. This result forms a crucial step in decomposition of the mixed tensor product as a bimodule over X-m,X-n boxed times U(q)sl(2 vertical bar 1). We give an explicit bimodule structure for all m, n.

The POM pool experiences thus considerable spatial and temporal variability. In order to better understand this variability, the present study employs statistical multivariate analyses to investigate links between POM composition and environmental forcings for a panel of twelve coastal systems distributed along the three maritime regions of France and monitored weekly to monthly for 1 to 8 years. At multi-system scale, two main gradients of POC composition have been identified: a 'Continent-Ocean' gradient associated with hydrodynamics, sedimentary dynamics and depth of the water column, and a gradient of trophic status related to nutrient availability. At local scale, seasonality of POC composition appears to be station-specific but still related to part of the above-mentioned forcings. A typology of systems was established by coupling spatial and temporal variability of POC composition. Four groups were highlighted: (1) the estuarine stations where POC composition is dominated by terrestrial POM and driven by hydrodynamics and sedimentary processes, (2) the oligotrophic systems, characterized by the contribution of diazotrophs due to low nutrient availability, and the marine meso/eutroph systems whose POC composition is (3) either deeply dominated by phytoplankton or (4) dominated by phytoplankton but where the contribution of continental and benthic POC is not negligible and is driven by hydrodynamics, sedimentary processes and the height of the water column. Finally, the present study provides several insights into the different forcings to POM composition and dynamics in temperate coastal systems at local and multi-system scales. This work also presents a methodological approach that establishes statistical links between forcings and POM composition, helping to gain more objectively insight of forcings.

Limiting Factors in Walking Performance of Subjects With COPD								RESPIRATORY CARE				63	3			301	310		10.4187/respcare.05768			MAR 1 2018	2018	INTRODUCTION: Exercise intolerance is the most predominant symptom in patients with COPD. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether walking economy and gait variability are altered in these patients. Thus, our main objective was to compare the cost of transport and gait variability as a function of speed, including the self-selected walking speed, in subjects with COPD relative to healthy subjects. METHODS: 22 subjects, 11 with COPD (FEV1 = 45 +/- 17% of predicted) and 11 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects undertook an evaluation that involved walking on a treadmill at 6 speeds (at 3.2 km/h, at a self-selected walking speed, and at 2 speeds below and 2 speeds above the self-selected walking speed) and measuring the cost of transport (the oxygen consumption normalized by mass and distance), gait variability, perceived dyspnea, and leg fatigue. RESULTS: In subjects with COPD, the cost of transport decreased with increasing walking speed, contrary to healthy subjects, who presented a minimum at the self-selected walking speed. No difference was found in cost of transport between the experimental groups at the same absolute velocity (P = .62). In subjects with COPD, dyspnea sensation rose above the self-selected walking speed, doubling at the maximal walking velocity (P = .03), and gait variability was higher at low speeds. CONCLUSION: Subjects with COPD choose their walking speed so as to keep the dyspnea sensation tolerable and to keep gait variability and cost of transport at an acceptable level. These outcomes suggest that interventions acting on dyspnea and gait pattern may increase patients' self-selected walking speed and improve their quality of life.

The debiased non-Bayesian retrieval mitigates the systematic errors produced by the contamination of the land over the sea. In addition, this retrieval improves the coverage by means of multiyear statistical filtering criteria. This methodology allows obtaining SMOS SSS fields in the Mediterranean Sea. However, the resulting SSS suffers from a seasonal (and other time-dependent) bias. This time-dependent bias has been characterized by means of specific Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs). Finally, high resolution Sea Surface Temperature (OSTIA SST) maps have been used for improving the spatial and temporal resolution of the SMOS SSS maps. The presented methodology practically reduces the error of the SMOS SSS in the Mediterranean Sea by half. As a result, the SSS dynamics described by the new SMOS maps in the Algerian Basin and the Balearic Front agrees with the one described by in situ SSS, and the mesoscale structures described by SMOS in the Alboran Sea and in the Gulf of Lion coincide with the ones described by the high resolution remotely-sensed SST images (AVHRR).

(or Saint John's Wort, SJW) phyto-extracts, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) hollow beads were prepared by one-step suspension polymerisation procedures and reported herein for the first time. The main reason for preparing such hollow materials refers to enhancing the accessibility of pH to the recognition sites that further leads to selective and high rebinding yields. In this respect, various terpolymer matrixes based on methacrylic acid (MAA), acrylonitrile (AN) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) were tested for the ability to form micron-sized hollow beads. Morpho-structural analyses of resulted MIP beads confirmed their hollow structure. Evaluating the influence of different parameters like solvent, pH and concentration of the feed SJW extract, upon recognition and re-binding ability of MIPs for various naphtodianthrones (NTs) from SJW phyto-extracts, reflected that the optimum rebinding concentration, specificity and selectivity for PH can be atributed to the MIP systems with 50:50 and 100:0 (wt./wt.) of MAA:AN.

We assume that the spins are immersed in a static magnetic field, with dispersion in the Larmor frequency, and are controlled by a time varying transverse field. Our goal is to steer the whole ensemble to the uniform "down" position. Two cases are addressed: for a finite ensemble of spins, we provide a control function (in feedback form) that asymptotically stabilizes the ensemble to the "down" position, generically with respect to the initial condition. For an ensemble containing a countable number of spins, we construct a sequence of control functions such that the sequence of the corresponding solutions pointwise converges, asymptotically in time, to the target state, generically with respect to the initial conditions. The control functions proposed are uniformly bounded and continuous. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on charge recycling between a tank capacitor and the bit line parasitic capacitor, a reference voltage is created dynamically and the memory precharge step starts from half the supply voltage. The precharge and word line activation are independent, avoiding the extra consumption due to the direct path between power supply and ground during precharge. The proposed circuit is implemented using a 55 nm High Voltage CMOS technology with a power supply of 1.2 V. Simulation results show a read access time of about 20.6 ns and an average power consumption of 0.56 mu W/MHz/bit in typical operating conditions at 27 degrees C.		[Ngueya, W.

Contrary to this established paradigm, this case reports on a 26-year-old, well-trained combat swimmer who succumbed to acute IPE during static immersion in temperate (21 degrees C) water, while using a front-mounted counterlung rebreather. The incident occurred during repeated depth-controlled ascent practice at the French military diving school. It was discovered that the diver had attempted to stop any gas leakage into the system by over-tightening the automatic diluent valve (ADV) (25th notch of 27) during the dive, thus causing a high resistance to inspiratory flow. The ventilatory constraints imposed by this ADV setting were assessed as a 3.2 Joulesu L-1 inspiratory work of breathing and -5 kPa (-50 mbar) transpulmonary pressure. This report confirms the key role of negative pressure breathing in the development of interstitial pulmonary oedema. Such a breathing pattern can cause a lowering of thoracic, airway and interstitial lung pressure, leading to high capillary pressure during each inspiration. Repetition of the diving drills resulted in an accumulation of interstitial lung water extravasation, causing pathological decompensation and proven symptoms.

The used data are from a beach survey and an inter-annual unique effort of marine debris sightings along the French Riviera in the North-Westem Mediterranean region. Offshore data have been collected during oceanic cruises while beach surveys were performed around Antibes city. Debris were found on 97% of the ocean transects, with a large spatial and temporal variability, showing contrasted areas of low (similar to 1 item/km(2)) and of high (> 10 items/km(2)) debris densities. Results suggest that the debris spatio-temporal distribution is related to the Northern current (NC) dynamics, the regional boundary current, with accumulation patterns in its core and external edge. By playing a role in the alongshore transport, such a boundary current can form a cross-shore transport barrier. Stranding events can then occur after strong on-shore wind bursts modifying the sea surface dynamics and breaking this transport barrier. It is also shown that episodic enhancement of the stranding rate can be explained by combining the NC dynamics with the wind forcing and the rainfall effect via the local river run-off. Conversely, off-shore wind bursts could also free the marine litter from the boundary current and export them towards the open sea.

Seven elite wheelchair basketball players performed two separate (SYN and ASY) straight-line 20-m sprints. ASY increased sprint time and decreased push frequency compared to SYN (p < 0.05). Peak velocity and total force for the mean of the last three pushes were higher in SYN. Rate of rise was higher in SYN for the first, second and third pushes (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found for peak power and mean work. SYN mode induces better performance (13% difference in speed). However, the increase in rate of rise, thus the expansion of the total force when gripping the hand rim, push frequency and total force in SYN modes seems to expand the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders during manual wheelchair propulsion for upper limb joints than ASY.

Methods A homogeneous group of nine highly trained trail runners performed an official TR race (27 km) and laboratory-based sessions to determine VO2max, %VO2max at VT, level RE (RE0%) and RE on a +10% slope, maximal voluntary concentric and eccentric knee extension torques, local endurance assessed by a fatigue index (FI), and a time to exhaustion at 87.5% of the velocity associated with VO2max. A simple regression method and commonality analysis identifying unique and common coefficients of each independent variable were used to determine the best predictors for the TR race time (dependent variable). Results Pearson correlations showed that FI and VO2max had the highest correlations (r = 0.91 and r = -0.76, respectively) with TR performance. The other selected variables were not significantly correlated with TR performance. The analysis of unique and common coefficients of relative VO2max, %VO2max at VT, and RE0% provides a low prediction of TR performance (R-2 = 0.48). However, adding FI and RE on a +10% slope (instead of RE0%) markedly improved the predictive power of the model (R-2 = 0.98). FI and VO2max showed the highest unique (49.8% and 20.4% of total effect, respectively) and common (26.9% of total effect) contributions to the regression equation. Conclusions The classic endurance running model does not allow for meaningful prediction of short TR performance. Incorporating more specific factors into TR such as local endurance and gradient-specific RE testing procedures should be considered to better characterize short TR performance.

In this paper, we characterize such behaviors by patterns, where each pattern type represents a particular behavior, e.g., emerging, latent, lost. From GPS raw data, we introduce algorithms that allow computing a formal concept lattice which encodes optimal correspondences between hidden patterns and trajectories. In order to detect behaviors, we propose an algorithm that analyzes the evolution of the discovered formal concepts over time. The method generates tagged city maps to easily visualize the resulting behaviors at different spatio-temporal granularity values. Refined or coarse analysis can thus be performed for a given situation. Experimental results using real-world GPS trajectory data show the relevance of the proposed method and the usefulness of the resulting tagged city maps.

Thanks to these intense observational efforts, we show that deep convection reached the bottom in winter early in February 2013 in a area of maximum 28 +/- 3 10(9) m(2). We present new quantitative results with estimates of heat and salt content at the subbasin scale at different time scales (on the seasonal scale to a 10 days basis) through optimal interpolation techniques, and robust estimates of the deep water formation rate of 2.0 +/- 0.2Sv. We provide an overview of the spatiotemporal coverage that has been reached throughout the seasons this year and we highlight some results based on data analysis and numerical modeling that are presented in this special issue. They concern key circulation features for the deep convection and the subsequent bloom such as Submesoscale Coherent Vortices (SCVs), the plumes, and symmetric instability at the edge of the deep convection area.

Subsequent negative impacts of nutrient loading to aquatic environments requires a better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling and better tools to track their sources. This study examines the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) discharge and cycling in a Mediterranean coastal area from rivers to marine sediments and assesses the anthropogenic contributions. Carbon and N concentrations and isotope compositions in rivers particles, surface sediments, and sediment cores were investigated to build up a quantitative multiple-end-member mixing model for C and N isotopes. This model predicts the contribution of four natural and one anthropogenic sources to the sediments and highlighted the anthropogenic fraction of P based on the relationship with anthropogenic delta N-15. Although P is a monoisotopic element and total P concentration has been the sole index to study P loading, this study suggests an alternative approach to differentiate anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic (diagenetic) P, revealed point and non-point sources of P, and the corresponding P loading. Also, the diagenetic P background has been calculated for the 50-cm sediment layer of the whole Bay. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.		[Duc Huy Dang; Evans, R.

This lagoon receives river inputs, oceanic water arrivals, and erosion pressure from ultramafic rocks, enriched in nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co). The aim of this study was to characterize colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as well as to determine its main sources and its possible relationships (through the use of Pearson correlation coefficients, r) with biogeochemical parameters, plankton communities and trace metals in the NC eastern lagoon. Water samples were collected in March 2016 along a series of river/lagoon/open-ocean transects. The absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a(350)) revealed the influence of river inputs on the CDOM distribution. The high values of spectral slope (S275-295, >0.03 m(-1)) and the low values of specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254), <4 L mg-C-1 m(-1)) highlighted the photodegradation of CDOM in surface waters. The application of parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) on excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) allowed the identification of four CDOM components: (1) one humic-and one tyrosine-like fluorophores. They had terrestrial origin, exported through rivers and undergoing photo-and bio-degradation in the lagoon. These two fluorophores were linked to manganese (Mn) in southern rivers (r = 0.46-0.50, n = 21, p < 0.05). (2) A tryptophan-like fluorophore, which exhibited higher levels offshore. It would be potentially released from the coral reef. (3) A second tyrosine-like ("tyrosine 2-like") fluorophore. Linked to Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria (r = 0.39, n = 47, p < 0.05), this fluorophore would have an oceanic origin and enter in the lagoon through its southern and northern extremities. It also displayed relationships with Ni and Co content (r = 0.53-0.54, n = 21, p < 0.05). This work underlines the diversity of CDOM sources in the NC eastern lagoon. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A hydro-sedimentary model is presented to better understand the dispersion of a hypothetical release of radionuclides and to gain insights into the potential effects on the surrounding ecosystem, especially on sea sediments. The aim of the model is to provide the foundation of a management tool for experts and stakeholders in decision making in case of an accidental release. We simulate a numerical radionuclide discharge in the military harbour under several climatic conditions and we compute Cs-137, which might have substantial impacts on the marine ecosystem, and Pu-239 for its high affinity for solid phase. Results show that wind conditions and solid discharges from the Las River are the primary influences on sediment-bed contamination, and the hydro-sedimentary dynamics following the first days of release have an important influence on the distribution of radionuclides.

The VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) An unbiased estimate of the growth rate of structure at < z >=0.85 using the clustering of luminous blue galaxies								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				610						A59	10.1051/0004-6361/201731685			FEB 28 2018	2018	We used the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) final data release (PDR-2) to investigate the performance of colour-selected populations of galaxies as tracers of linear large-scale motions. We empirically selected volume-limited samples of blue and red galaxies as to minimise the systematic error on the estimate of the growth rate of structure f sigma(8) from the anisotropy of the two-point correlation function. To this end, rather than rigidly splitting the sample into two colour classes we defined the red or blue fractional contribution of each object through a weight based on the (U-V) colour distribution. Using mock surveys that are designed to reproduce the observed properties of VIPERS galaxies, we find the systematic error in recovering the fiducial value of f sigma(8) to be minimised when using a volume-limited sample of luminous blue galaxies. We modelled non-linear corrections via the Scoccimarro extension of the Kaiser model (with updated fitting formulae for the velocity power spectra), finding systematic errors on f sigma(8) of below 1-2%, using scales as small as 5 h(-1) Mpc. We interpret this result as indicating that selection of luminous blue galaxies maximises the fraction that are central objects in their dark matter haloes; this in turn minimises the contribution to the measured xi(r(p), pi) from the 1-halo term, which is dominated by non-linear motions. The gain is inferior if one uses the full magnitude-limited sample of blue objects, consistent with the presence of a significant fraction of blue, fainter satellites dominated by non-streaming, orbital velocities. We measured a value of f sigma(8) = 0.45 +/- 0.11 over the single redshift range 0.6 <= z <= 1.0, corresponding to an effective redshift for the blue galaxies < z > = 0.85. Including in the likelihood the potential extra information contained in the blue-red galaxy cross-correlation function does not lead to an appreciable improvement in the error bars, while it increases the systematic error.

Strong linkages between depth, longevity and demographic stability across marine sessile species								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				285	1873					20172688	10.1098/rspb.2017.2688			FEB 28 2018	2018	Understanding the role of the environment in shaping the evolution of life histories remains a major challenge in ecology and evolution. We synthesize longevity patterns of marine sessile species and find strong positive relationships between depth and maximum lifespan across multiple sessile marine taxa, including corals, bivalves, sponges and macroalgae. Using long-term demographic data on marine sessile and terrestrial plant species, we show that extreme longevity leads to strongly dampened population dynamics. We also used detailed analyses of Mediterranean red coral, with a maximum lifespan of 532 years, to explore the life-history patterns of long-lived taxa and the vulnerability to external mortality sources that these characteristics can create. Depth-related environmental gradients-including light, food availability, temperature and disturbance intensity-drive highly predictable distributions of life histories that, in turn, have predictable ecological consequences for the dynamics of natural populations.

Such null surfaces, made of pieces of light cones, are bifurcate conformal Killing horizons for suitable conformally stationary observers. They can be extremal and nonextremal depending on the radius of the shining sphere. Such conformal Killing horizons have a constant light cone (conformal) temperature, given by the standard expression in terms of the generalization of surface gravity for conformal Killing horizons. Exchanges of conformally invariant energy across the horizon are described by a first law where entropy changes are given by 1/(4l(p)(2)) pthorn of the changes of a geometric quantity with the meaning of horizon area in a suitable conformal frame. These conformal horizons satisfy the zeroth to the third laws of thermodynamics in an appropriate way. In the extremal case they become light cones associated with a single event; these have vanishing temperature as well as vanishing entropy.

Bacterial-viral interactions in the sea surface microlayer of a black carbon-dominated tropical coastal ecosystem (Halong Bay, Vietnam)								ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE				6						13	10.1525/elementa.276			FEB 9 2018	2018	Increasing human activity has raised concerns about the impact of deposition of anthropogenic combustion aerosols (i.e., black carbon; BC) on marine processes. The sea surface microlayer (SML) is a key gate for the introduction of atmospheric BC into the ocean; however, relatively little is known of the effects of BC on bacteria-virus interactions, which can strongly influence microbially mediated processes. To study the impact of BC on bacteria-virus interactions, field investigations involving collection from the SML and underlying water were carried out in Halong Bay (Vietnam). Most inorganic nutrient concentrations, as well as dissolved organic carbon, were modestly but significantly higher (p = 0.02-0.05) in the SML than in underlying water. The concentrations of particulate organic carbon (though not chlorophyll a) and of total particulate carbon, which was composed largely of particulate BC (mean = 1.7 +/- 6.4 mmol L-1), were highly enriched in the SML, and showed high variability among stations. On average, microbial abundances (both bacteria and viruses) and bacterial production were 2- and 5fold higher, respectively, in the SML than in underlying water. Significantly lower bacterial production (p < 0.01) was observed in the particulate fraction (> 3 mu m) compared to the bulk sample, but our data overall suggest that bacterial production in the SML was stimulated by particulate BC. Higher bacterial production in the SML than in underlying water supported high viral lytic infection rates (from 5.3 to 30.1%) which predominated over percent lysogeny (from undetected to 1.4%). The sorption of dissolved organic carbon by black carbon, accompanied by the high lytic infection rate in the black carbon-enriched SML, may modify microbially mediated processes and shift the net ecosystem metabolism (ratio of production and respiration) to net heterotrophy and CO2 production in this critical layer between ocean and atmosphere.

For a given posture of the upper-limb, it represents the set of isometric forces that can be applied on the handrim in any direction. The force feasible set was predicted from a musculoskeletal model of the upper-limb and trunk (10 degrees of freedom and 56 muscles). The aim of the first part of the study was to compare the force feasible set prediction and the force currently applied on the handrim. The second part proposes the creation of a new index called "Musculoskeletal Postural Performance Index" (MPPI) derived from the force feasible set and its comparison with the Mechanical Efficiency Force (MEF). These comparisons were conducted at 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140% of the Freely Chosen Frequency at submaximal and maximal conditions on 5 different phases of the push phase. The values of the MPPI were significantly correlated with those of the MEF. During the course of the push phase, the orientation of the force feasible set main axis approached that of the measured force and the force effectiveness evaluated through the MPPI increased.

Here we discuss evolutionary competition at various scales, and how this has affected biogeochemical cycles of silicon, carbon, and other nutrients. Across geological time we examine how fossils, sediments, and isotopic geochemistry can provide evidence for the emergence and expansion of silica biomineralization in the ocean, and competition between silicifying organisms for silicic acid. Metagenomic data from marine environments can be used to illustrate evolutionary competition between groups of silicifying and non-silicifying marine organisms. Modern ecosystems also provide examples of arms races between silicifiers as predators and prey, and how silicification can be used to provide a competitive advantage for obtaining resources. Through studying the molecular biology of silicifying and non-silicifying species we can relate how they have responded to the competitive interactions that are observed, and how solutions have evolved through convergent evolutionary dynamics.

These materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Raman (FT-Raman) spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction profile analyses were performed using Rietveld method. These materials crystallized in the scheelite tetragonal structure and behaved as quasi ideal solid solution. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of the solid solution. Structural distortions were evidenced in X-ray diffraction profiles and in vibration Raman spectra. The scanning electron microscopy experiments showed large and rounded irregular grains. Luminescence experiments were performed under X-ray excitation. The luminescence emission profiles have been interpreted in terms of four Gaussian components, with a major contribution of blue emission. The integrated intensity of luminescence reached a maximum value in the composition range x = 0.3-0.6, in relation with distortions of crystal lattice.

Soil organic matter in podzol horizons of the Amazon region: Humification, recalcitrance, and dating								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				613				160	167		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.068			FEB 1 2018	2018	Characteristics of soil organic matter (SOM) are important, especially in the Amazon region, which represents one of theworld's most relevant carbon reservoirs. In this work, the concentrations of carbon and differences in its composition (humification indexes) were evaluated and compared for several horizons (0 to 390 cm) of three typical Amazonian podzol profiles. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to investigate the humic acid (HA) fractions of SOM isolated from the different samples. Simple and labile carbon structures appeared to be accumulated in surface horizons, while more complex humified compounds were leached and accumulated in intermediate and deeper Bh horizons. The results suggested that the humic acids originated from lignin and its derivatives, and that lignin could accumulate in some Bh horizons. The HA present in deeper Bh horizons appeared to originate from different formation pathways, since these horizons showed different compositions. There were significant compositional changes of HA with depth, with four types of organic matter: recalcitrant, humified, and old dating; labile and young dating; humified and young dating; and little humified and old dating. Therefore, the humification process had no direct relation with the age of the organic matter in the Amazonian podzols. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This has never been performed before. The robustness of the model results is assessed by comparison with remote sensing and in situ observations. Our results highlight regions of warm waters leeward of the different islands with high eddy kinetic energy (EKE) on their sides. The analysis of energy conversion terms reveals contributions to EKE variability by wind, baroclinic, and barotropic instabilities. The use of a geometry-based eddy detection algorithm reveals the generation of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies in the wake of the largest islands, with both an inshore and offshore effect. Maximum eddy activity occurs in austral winter following the seasonality of both wind stress and EKE intensity. Most eddies have a radius between 20 and 30 km and are generally cyclonic rather than anticyclonic. Significant vertical velocities are observed in the proximity of the islands, associated with topographically induced flow separation. Eddy trapping inshore waters are advected offshore in the wake of the islands. The overall influence of these fine-scale dynamics could explain the strong biological enhancement of the archipelago.

The experimentally obtained molecular weight distributions are narrow and shift linearly with monomer conversion. Propagation rate coefficients (k(p)) and termination rate coefficients (k(t)) for free radical polymerization of TBDMSMA have been determined for a range of temperature between 50 and 80 degrees C using the pulsed laser polymerization-size-exclusion chromatography (PLP-SEC) method and the kinetic method via steady-state rate measurement, respectively. The CPDB-mediated RAFT polymerization of TBDMSMA has been subjected to a combined experimental and PREDICI modeling study at 70 degrees C. The rate coefficient for the addition reaction to RAFT agent (k(beta 1), k(beta 2)) and to polymeric RAFT agent (k) is estimated to be approximately 1.8 x 10(4) Lmol(-1)s(-1) and for the fragmentation reaction of intermediate RAFT radicals in the pre-equilibrium (k(-beta 1), k(-beta 2)) and main equilibrium (k(beta)) is close to 2.0 x 10(-2) s(-1). The transfer rate coefficient (k(tr)) to cyanoisopropyl dithiobenzoate is found to be close to 9.0 x 10(3) Lmol(-1)s(-1) and the chain-transfer constant (C-tr) for CPDB-mediated RAFT polymerization of TBDMSMA is about 9.3.

J	Rezzoug, Nasser; Hansen, Clint; Gorce, Philippe; Isableu, Brice								Contribution of interaction torques during dart throwing: Differences between novices and experts								HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE				57				258	266		10.1016/j.humov.2017.09.004			FEB 2018	2018	We examined if experts and novices show different utilization of the torque components impulses during dart throwing. Participants threw darts continuously at a dartboard aiming for the centre (target bull's eye). The upper-limb joint torque impulses were obtained through inverse dynamics with anthropometric and motion capture data as input. Depending on the joint degree of freedom (DOF) and movement phase (acceleration and follow-through), three main strategies of net torque (NET) impulse generation through joint muscle (MUS) and interaction (INT) torque impulses were highlighted. Firstly, our results showed that the elbow flexion-extension DOF leads the movement according to the joint leading hypothesis. Then, considering the acceleration phase, the analysis revealed differences in torque impulse decomposition between expert and novices. For the glenohumeral (GH) joint abduction-adduction and for wrist flexion, the INT torque impulse contributed positively to NET joint torque impulse in the group of experts unlike novices. This allowed to lower the necessary MUS torque impulse at these DOFs. Also, GH axial rotation was actively controlled by muscle torque impulse in the group of experts. During the follow-through, the experts used the INT torque impulse more proficiently than novices to break the elbow extension. The comparison between experts and novices through inverse dynamics document the link between the exploitation of interaction torques impulses and expertise in dart throwing for which the main objective is precision rather than velocity.

Using the statistical criteria, the Baranyi-Roberts model has been selected to estimate the microalgae growth-kinetic values. The simultaneous effects of salinity, light intensity and pH of culture medium were investigated to maximize the production of total chlorophylls, carotenoids and starch. The optimal culture conditions for the production of these compounds were found using Box-Behnken Design. Results have shown that total chlorophyll and carotenoids were attained 21.6 mg.g(-1) DW and 0.042 mg.g(-1) DW, respectively. In addition, the highest starch content of 0.624 g.g(-1) DW has been obtained at neutral pH with high irradiance (182 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and low salinity (20). A highly correlation (R-2=0.884) has been found between the gravimetric and flow cytometric measurements of chlorophyll content.

In particular, we derive the Jauho-Meir-Wingreen formula for the time-dependent current through an interacting sample coupled to non-interacting leads. Our proof is non-perturbative and uses neither complex-time Keldysh contours nor Langreth rules of 'analytic continuation.' We also discuss other technical identities (Langreth, Keldysh) involving various many-body Green's functions. Finally, we study the Dyson equation for the advanced/retarded interacting Green's function and we rigorously construct its (irreducible) self-energy, using the theory of Volterra operators.

Moreover, a number of recent studies have started to go beyond the assumption of an absence of coupling between the spread of a disease and the structure of the contacts on which it unfolds. Models including awareness of the spread have been proposed, to mimic possible precautionary measures taken by individuals that decrease their risk of infection, but have mostly considered static networks. Here, we adapt such a framework to the more realistic case of temporal networks of interactions between individuals. We study the resulting model by analytical and numerical means on both simple models of temporal networks and empirical time-resolved contact data. Analytical results show that the epidemic threshold is not affected by the awareness but that the prevalence can be significantly decreased. Numerical studies on synthetic temporal networks highlight, however, the presence of very strong finite-size effects, resulting in a significant shift of the effective epidemic threshold in the presence of risk awareness. For empirical contact networks, the awareness mechanism leads as well to a shift in the effective threshold and to a strong reduction of the epidemic prevalence.

Here, we use a metatranscriptomics approach to capture expressed genes in open ocean Tara Oceans stations across four organismal size fractions. The individual sequence reads cluster into 116 million unigenes representing the largest reference collection of eukaryotic transcripts from any single biome. The catalog is used to unveil functions expressed by eukaryotic marine plankton, and to assess their functional biogeography. Almost half of the sequences have no similarity with known proteins, and a great number belong to new gene families with a restricted distribution in the ocean. Overall, the resource provides the foundations for exploring the roles of marine eukaryotes in ocean ecology and biogeochemistry.

J	Jay, Sylvain; Guillaume, Mireille; Chami, Malik; Minghelli, Audrey; Deville, Yannick; Lafrance, Bruno; Serfaty, Veronique								Predicting minimum uncertainties in the inversion of ocean color geophysical parameters based on Cramer-Rao bounds								OPTICS EXPRESS				26	2			A1	A18		10.1364/OE.26.0000A1			JAN 22 2018	2018	We present an analytical approach based on Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRBs) to investigate the uncertainties in estimated ocean color parameters resulting from the propagation of uncertainties in the bio-optical reflectance modeling through the inversion process. Based on given bio-optical and noise probabilistic models, CRBs can be computed efficiently for any set of ocean color parameters and any sensor configuration, directly providing the minimum estimation variance that can be possibly attained by any unbiased estimator of any targeted parameter. Here, CRBs are explicitly developed using (1) two water reflectance models corresponding to deep and shallow waters, resp., and (2) four probabilistic models describing the environmental noises observed within four Sentinel-2 MSI, HICO, Sentinel-3 OLCI and MODIS images, resp. For both deep and shallow waters, CRBs are shown to be consistent with the experimental estimation variances obtained using two published remote-sensing methods, while not requiring one to perform any inversion. CRBs are also used to investigate to what extent perfect a priori knowledge on one or several geophysical parameters can improve the estimation of remaining unknown parameters. For example, using pre-existing knowledge of bathymetry (e.g., derived from LiDAR) within the inversion is shown to greatly improve the retrieval of bottom cover for shallow waters. Finally, CRBs are shown to provide valuable information on the best estimation performances that may be achieved with the MSI, HICO, OLCI and MODIS configurations for a variety of oceanic, coastal and inland waters. CRBs are thus demonstrated to be an informative and efficient tool to characterize minimum uncertainties in inverted ocean color geophysical parameters.

ANTARES Collaboration						All-flavor Search for a Diffuse Flux of Cosmic Neutrinos with Nine Years of ANTARES Data								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS				853	1					L7	10.3847/2041-8213/aaa4f6			JAN 20 2018	2018	The ANTARES detector is at present the most sensitive neutrino telescope in the northern hemisphere. The highly significant cosmic neutrino excess observed by the Antarctic IceCube detector can be studied with ANTARES, exploiting its complementing field of view, exposure, and lower energy threshold. Searches for an all-flavor diffuse neutrino signal, covering nine years of ANTARES data taking, are presented in this Letter. Upward-going events are used to reduce the atmospheric muon background. This work includes for the first time in ANTARES both track-like (mainly nu mu) and shower-like (mainly nu(e)) events in this kind of analysis. Track-like events allow for an increase of the effective volume of the detector thanks to the long path traveled by muons in rock and/ or sea water. Shower-like events are well reconstructed only when the neutrino interaction vertex is close to, or inside, the instrumented volume. A mild excess of high-energy events over the expected background is observed in nine years of ANTARES data in both samples. The best fit for a single power-law cosmic neutrino spectrum, in terms of perflavor flux at 100 TeV, is Phi(1f)(0) (100 TeV) = (1.7 +/- 1.0) x 10(-18) GeV-1 cm(-2) s(-1) sr(-1) with spectral index Gamma = 2.4(-0.4)(+0.5) .The null cosmic flux assumption is rejected with a significance of 1.6 sigma .

The VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) Full spectroscopic data and auxiliary information release (PDR-2)								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				609						A84	10.1051/0004-6361/201630114			JAN 18 2018	2018	We present the full public data release (PDR-2) of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), performed at the ESO VLT. We release redshifts, spectra, CFHTLS magnitudes and ancillary information (as masks and weights) for a complete sample of 86,775 galaxies (plus 4,732 other objects, including stars and serendipitous galaxies); we also include their full photometrically-selected parent catalogue. The sample is magnitude limited to i(AB) <= 22.5, with an additional colour-colour pre-selection devised as to exclude galaxies at z<0.5. This practically doubles the effective sampling of the VIMOS spectrograph over the range 0.5 < z < 1.2 (reaching 47% on average), yielding a final median local galaxy density close to 5 x 10(-3) h(-3) Mpc(-3). The total area spanned by the final data set is similar or equal to 23.5 deg(-2), corresponding to 288 VIMOS fields with marginal overlaps, split over two regions within the CFHTLS-Wide W1 and W4 equatorial fields (at R.A. similar or equal to 2 and similar or equal to 22 hours, respectively). Spectra were observed at a resolution R=220, covering a wavelength range 5500-9500 Angstrom. Data reduction and redshift measurements were performed through a fully automated pipeline; all redshift determinations were then visually validated and assigned a quality flag. Measurements with a quality flag >= 2 are shown to have a confidence level of 96% or larger and make up 88% of all measured galaxy redshifts (76,552 out of 86,775), constituting the VIPERS prime catalogue for statistical investigations. For this sample the rms redshift error, estimated using repeated measurements of about 3,000 galaxies, is found to be sigma(z) = 0.00054(1+z). All data are available at http://vipers.inaf.it and on the ESO Archive.

Structural, morphological, electrical and gas-sensing properties of these compounds were investigated by various techniques, such as XRD, MEB and electric resistance measurements (from 30 to 350 degrees C). These compounds were found to exhibit a single phase and crystallized in the orthorhombic symmetry with a Pnma space group. Otherwise, we found that the substitution of iron (Fe) ion by cobalt (Co) one does not change the principal phase. The La0.8Ca0.1Pb0.1Fe1-xCoxO3 sensor showed interesting gas sensing performances towards ammonia (NH3) gas. On the other hand, the La0.8Ca0.1Pb0.1Fe1-xCoxO3 (x = 0.05) sensor exhibited an early selectivity to ammonia at 270 degrees C including the ability to detect low concentrations of N-3 (10 ppm).

This is notably the case for the complex trophic webs of coral reef ecosystems. Our results show that in the south-west lagoon of New Caledonia both abiotic (i.e. sediments) and biotic (i.e. primary producers, consumers and predators) compartments are contaminated by trace elements. However, our analyses revealed different contamination patterns from the sources of organic matter to the predators. The trophic levels involved in the sedimentary benthic foodweb (S-BFW, based on the sedimentary organic matter) and to a lesser extent in the reef benthic food web (R-BFW, based on algal turf) were mainly contaminated by trace elements that originate from mining activities like Ni and associated trace elements (Co, Cr, Fe, and Mn). Trace elements linked to agro-industrial (As, Hg, and Zn) and urban (Ag, Cd, Cu, Pb, Se, and V) activities were also integrated into the S-BFW, but preferentially into the R-BFW, and to a lesser extent into the detrital benthic food web (D-BFW, supplied by sea-grass plants). Most of the trace elements were biodiminished with increasing trophic levels along food webs. However, a marked biomagnification was observed for Hg, and suspected for Se and Zn. These results provide important baseline information to better interpret trace element contamination in the different organisms and trophic levels in a highly diversified coral reef lagoon.

However, modifications have been intensively explored in the regimes where it seems either incomplete or signals its own limit of validity. In particular, the breakdown of unitarity near the Planck scale strongly suggests that General Relativity needs to be modified at high energies and quantum gravity effects are expected to be important. This is related to the existence of spacetime singularities when the solutions of General Relativity are extrapolated to regimes where curvatures are large. In this sense, Born-Infeld inspired modifications of gravity have shown an extraordinary ability to regularise the gravitational dynamics, leading to non-singular cosmologies and regular black hole spacetimes in a very robust manner and without resorting to quantum gravity effects. This has boosted the interest in these theories in applications to stellar structure, compact objects, inflationary scenarios, cosmological singularities, and black hole and wormhole physics, among others. We review the motivations, various formulations, and main results achieved within these theories, including their observational viability, and provide an overview of current open problems and future research opportunities.

Light is the key to modulating NF; however, field studies investigating the light response curve (NF-I curve) of NF rate and the effect of light on diazotrophderived nitrogen (DDN) net release are relatively sparse in the literature, hampering prediction using models. A dissolution method was applied using uncontaminated N-15(2) gas to examine how the light changes may influence the NF intensity and DDN net release in the oligotrophic ocean. Experiments were conducted at stations with diazotrophs dominated by filamentous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. in the western Pacific and the South China Sea. The effect of light on carbon fixation (CF) was measured in parallel using the C-13 tracer method specifically for a station characterized by Trichodesmium bloom. Both NF-I and CF-I curves showed a I-k (light saturation coefficient) range of 193 to 315 mu Em(-2) s(-1), with light saturation at around 400 mu Em(-2) s(-1). The proportion of DDN net release ranged from similar to 6 to similar to 50 %, suggesting an increasing trend as the light intensity decreased. At the Trichodesmium bloom station, we found that the CF/NF ratio was light-dependent and the ratio started to increase as light was lower than the carbon compensation point of 200 mu Em(-2) s(-1). Under low-light stress, Trichodesmium physiologically preferred to allocate more energy for CF to alleviate the intensive carbon consumption by respiration; thus, there is a metabolism tradeoff between CF and NF pathways. Results showed that shortterm (< 24 h) light change modulates the physiological state, which subsequently determined the C/N metabolism and DDN net release by Trichodesmium. Reallocation of energy associated with the variation in light intensity would be helpful for prediction of the global biogeochemical cycle of N by models involving Trichodesmium blooms.

In this paper, the application of interest is estimating the orientation of the wrist in indoor and outdoor activities using low cost Inertial Measurement Sensor IMU. We present an orientation estimation using Kalman Filter based on Correntropy Criterion (KFCC). The proposed method uses only the acceleration data in the aim to reduce the computing load with accurate orientation estimation. Optical measurement system has been used to benchmark the performance of the proposed method. Moreover, the KFCC is evaluated in indoor and outdoor activities with static and dynamic motion conditions. The proposed method proves its efficiency and reliability against existing methods.

We prove decidability of the energy-constrained infinite-run problem in settings with both certainty and uncertainty of the energy rates. We also consider the optimization problem of identifying the minimal upper bound that will permit existence of energy-constrained infinite runs. Our algorithms are based on quantifier elimination for linear real arithmetic. Using Mathematica and Mjollnir, we illustrate our framework through a real industrial example of a hydraulic oil pump. Compared with previous approaches our method is completely automated and provides improved results.

Automatic and fast AF diagnosis is still a major concern for the healthcare professional. Several algorithms based on univariate and multivariate analysis have been developed to detect AF. The published results do not show satisfactory detection accuracy especially for brief duration as short as one minute. Although RVM has been applied on tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition etc., this is the first attempt to adopt RVM for AF diagnosis. Four publicly-accessible sets of clinical data (AF Termination Challenge Database, MIT-BIH AF, Normal Sinus Rhythm RR Interval Database, and MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Databases) were used for assessment. All time series were segmented in 1 min RR interval window and then three specific features were calculated. The RVM classifier was trained on 2000 randomly selected samples from the merged database. The results showed that the RVM model performed better than do existing algorithms, with 99.20% for both sensitivity and specificity.

A classical approach is to perform inversion of the water column using semi-analytical parametric models and estimation process, and obtain the water column constituents (chlorophyll, suspended matter, dissolved organic matter and bathymetry), and the coefficients of pure materials reflectance spectra (endmembers), given in spectral libraries, for each pixel. We consider here the case of unknown endmembers, and we suppose that the water column components have been obtained by a classical inversion method or in-situ measurements. For each observed pixel the upward luminance is analysed and decomposed into three terms, respectively issued after interaction with the target bottom pixel, its neighbours, and the water column. We show that in some conditions the adjacent pixels effect is not negligible, due to the diffusion in the water column, and we develop in accordance a new mixing model for the sea bottom. We propose a non-negative matrix factorisation based unmixing method to solve the problem, and present results for hyperspectral data simulations.

Furthermore, we also exploit motion information from dense trajectories to boost the discriminative power of the proposed descriptor.

OPEN COMPUTER SCIENCE				8	1			218	227		10.1515/comp-2018-0021			JAN 2018	2018	Whether or not word sense disambiguation (WSD) can improve information retrieval (IR) results represents a topic that has been intensely debated over the years, with many inconclusive or contradictory conclusions. The most rarely used type of WSD for this task is the unsupervised one, although it has been proven to be beneficial at a large scale. Our study builds on existing research and tries to improve the most recent unsupervised method which is based on spectral clustering. It investigates the possible benefits of "helping" spectral clustering through feature selection when it performs sense discrimination for IR. Results obtained so far, involving large data collections, encourage us to point out the importance of feature selection even in the case of this advanced, state of the art clustering technique that is known for performing its own feature weighting. By suggesting an improvement of what we consider the most promising approach to usage of WSD in IR, and by commenting on its possible extensions, we state that WSD still holds a promise for IR and hope to stimulate continuation of this line of research, perhaps at an even more successful level.

We can also identify the tastes of each person and predict his reaction through facial features. Indeed, the detection, classification, characterization of the face are research areas that have received considerable interest in the recent twenty years. However, most published works in this field study the emotions for a person in an upright posture, which means that the person must perfectly face the camera. The innovation in the present work is to improve the detection of emotions in the case of different face orientations (to the right, left, up and down). Eight-teen feature points that perfectly characterize the human face are firstly calculated. An optimization step is proposed by extracting a set of optimal distances between the facial points as a new set of optimized emotion descriptors. For this reason, we have used a statistical characterization criterion based on the ratio of the intraclass variance. An emotion classification experiment is carried out using a multilayer neural network implemented with a digital signal processing microcontroller.

A framework for future CAM software dedicated to additive manufacturing by multi-axis deposition								Procedia CIRP				78				79	84		10.1016/j.procir.2018.08.314			2018	2018	Deposition processes, such as Wire & Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), have important perspectives in industry, due to their capacity to produce large near-shape parts with high productivity. Beyond process-material issues, deposition path planning is one of the major challenges to allow a wide use of these processes using multi-axis machines or robots. Early CAM software solutions dedicated to multi-axis additive manufacturing have been already commercialised. However, few elementary deposition strategies are currently available. In this article, the possibilities of multi-axis deposition and the developments needed to improve deposition path generation are highlighted through the analysis of a hollow half-sphere as a case study. Deposition strategies are experimentally tested on two different robotised polymer deposition systems. Based on the comparison of the trials, the issues related to the portability of technology from a specific machine setup to a different one are discussed. Finally, a framework for future Computer-Aided Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing (CAMAAM) software is proposed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using a quantum model we show that, by broadening the density-of-states in the bandgap, the scattering changes the absorption/emission ratio and then some photovoltaic parameters like V-oc. For the high mobility GaAs material we obtain a moderate V-oc reduction of 4mV. In the highly polar CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite material, even through the mobility is low, the broadening in the density-of-states is limited by the small phonon energy and then the V-oc reduction remains inferior to 41mV.

However, one of the major interferences of ethanol detection on the skin is the acetone. Skin acetone is generated from a natural metabolic intermediate of endogenous lipolysis in human and is considered as biomarker of ketotic state of diabetic [2].

Thus, this paper describes a novel deep learning based maritime situation awareness approach using high-definition video. Maritime object detection is achieved in three main steps. At first, a key region based tracking algorithm allows to, dynamically and parsimoniously, extract high-quality region proposals mainly focalized around rigid (i.e.; potential object) video locations. The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects. Furthermore, the found object detections are fed into a second classification RCNN, specifically, trained to recognize up to 40 vessel classes. Our experiments have shown that the proposed approach achieves state of the art speed and accuracy.

In this paper, we consider systems modeled by a special class of synchronized Petri nets, called 1-place-unbounded, that contain a single unbounded place. The infinite reachability spaces of such nets can be characterized by two types of finite graphs, called improved modified coverability graph and weighted automata with safety conditions. In case these two finite graphs are deterministic, we develop novel computation algorithms for synchronizing sequences for this class of nets by decomposing the finite graphs into strongly connected components.

Estimating the influence spread is a preliminary step to determine a suitable or even optimal set of initial users to reach a given goal. In this paper, we focus on a stochastic model called the Independent Cascade model, and compare a few approaches to compute activation probabilities of nodes in a social network, i.e., the probability that a user adopts the innovation. In the paper, first we propose the Path Method which computes the exact value of the activation probabilities but it has high complexity. Second an approximated method, called SSS-Noself, is obtained by modification of the existing SteadyStateSpread algorithm, based on fixed-point computation, to achieve a better accuracy. Finally an efficient approach, also based on fixed-point computation, is proposed to compute the probability that a node is activated though a path of minimal length from the seed set. This algorithm, called SSS-Bound-t algorithm, can provide a lower-bound for the computation of activation probabilities.

The idea behind this approach is to produce a variety of heartbeat time series features employing several linear and nonlinear functions via different dynamics of the QRS complex signal. These extracted features from these dynamics will be connected through machine learning based algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), to detect AF episode occurrences. The reported performances of these methods were evaluated on the Long-Term AF Database which includes 84 of 24-hour ECG recording. Thereafter, each record was divided into consecutive intervals of one-minute segments to feed the classifier models. The obtained sensitivity, specificity and positive classification using SVM were 96.54%, 99.69%, and 99.62%, respectively, and for MKL they reached 95.47%, 99.89%, and 99.87%, respectively. Therefore, these medical-oriented detectors can be clinically valuable to healthcare professional for screening AF pathology.

The present study investigates spatial and temporal changes of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) contents in the North-Eastern part of Japan, in the Pacific Ocean after the tsunami with a geostationary ocean color sensor. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) launched in 2010, covers an area of 2,500 km x 2,500 km centered on the Korean peninsula, including the Japanese area and provides 8 images per day allowing the analysis of rapid changes that can occur during the day. Corrected from the atmospheric effect, the images were used to estimate the SPM concentrations maps. These maps were then analyzed between 5 March and 25 May 2011. The SPM notably increased (by 250 %) both along the coast and in the Bay of Sendai shortly after the tsunami and stable structures of SPM appeared at 2, 14, 25 and 37 km from the coast. In this paper we attempt to explain the origin and the fate of the SPM concentration observed till the end of May 2011 through analysis of meteorological conditions, river discharges and tsunami waves properties.

The fusion between water and foam classes shows a separation between water and land. Results of each method are compared to the validation data.

Investigating the effects of sea-level rise on morphodynamics in the western Giens tombolo, France								IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				167						012027	10.1088/1755-1315/167/1/012027			2018	2018	Rising sea level along with the occurrence of greater and more frequent storms would cause not only coastal flooding, but also beach erosion and shoreline retreat problems. The Almanarre beach along the western Giens tombolo is socio-economically and heavily vulnerable to accelerated sea level rise due to its high touristic value and low-lying topography. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the impacts of sea level rise (SLR) on the morphodynamics in this area, e.g. to evaluate the relationship between the beach erosion and SLR. Coupled hydrodynamic and sediment transport numerical models are used to investigate the changes in current, wave and sediment dynamics when sea level rises.

With an average power consumption of 34 mu W, this wake-up detector is able to detect signals in different frequency bands, generating a separate output interrupt for each of them. Adding an additional frequency band detector only costs an additional 500nA. Applications to data retrieval in a military smart dust using a drone on a battlefield, and for activation and synchronization of a environmental wireless sensor network are presented. This later uses a multi-frequency light pulses burst propagation algorithm for triggering a whole wireless sensor network in harsh conditions such as a dense rain forest in 50ms, and for synchronizing it with a timing precision of less than 20 mu s in a large network.

Focused on environmental or military Internet of Things (IoT) applications, it aims at detecting in real time the presence of specific animal species or drones for generating alerts and for triggering power consuming tasks such as high frequency signal recording only when needed. This wake-up detector continuously monitors the presence of specific frequencies in an analog acoustic signal, with a good frequency selectivity and a high frequency detection capability. It is based on an ultra-low analog frequency to voltage converter using a current-mirror, analog timers and comparators. Dedicated to long term stealth environmental or military surveys, a strong emphasis has been put on power consumption reduction in order to limit size and weight of the system. This power consumption has been reduced to 34 mu W, leading to a full year of autonomy including the microphone when powered by 3 coin cell CR2032 batteries.

In this paper, we provide discrete counterparts to the main gauge theoretical concepts, directly in terms of Cellular Automata. More precisely, we describe a step-by-step gauging procedure to enforce local symmetries upon a given Cellular Automaton. We apply it to a simple Reversible Cellular Automaton for concreteness. From a Computer Science perspective, discretized gauge theories may be of use in numerical analysis, quantum simulation, fault-tolerant (quantum) computation. From a mathematical perspective, discreteness provides a simple yet rigorous route straight to the core concepts.

Piloting is an activity with many constraints. It could have conflicting situations and an uncertain environment. When a pilot faces such kind of situations, he enters into reasoning under uncertainty. Because maybe there are rules with incomplete and contradictory informations, e.i. legislation rules, tower control orders, security rules ... Despite the fact that decisions have to be taken at all times regarding different objectives. Default logic is used to find fixed points from ambiguous and conflicting informations. The model proposed here embeds a knowledge of the world based on a set of situations, objectives and actions. After computation of plausible solutions, decision-making is expressed thanks to a non-probabilistic model. On the other hand, we also study the property of resilience which allows to absorb and modify to overcome disturbances. The core of this property is based on the interaction of the possible solutions and the connectivity of its states. Including the resilience in our model allows to carry out the convergence of one or several goals. Eventually, we present some preliminary results of the implementation.

Several current control strategies have been used in literature. Among these strategies, Sliding Mode Control (SMC) has been applied widely. However, the chattering phenomenon, caused by the oscillations, is the main drawback of SMC. In our paper, we propose a new method based on the adaptive Sliding Mode Control (ASMC) in order to eliminate the chattering effect. The performance of both controllers, CSMC and ASMC, has been evaluated through simulation in MATLAB/SIMULINK.

The mechanical setup is a free decay pendulum that is equipped with an encoder. The first contribution of this paper deals with the comparison of two estimation methods: one method that fits the acceleration of the dynamical model with the acceleration obtained from derivatives of the measured angular position, and another method that fits this position with the angle obtained by numerical integration. The second contribution consists of investigating to what extent estimated added mass and friction coefficient parameters of the dynamical model match the empirical or theoretical values in the case of a spherical object. The results obtained show that the numerical integration method allows to determine the added mass with a good accuracy and a single friction coefficient could be used for the dynamic model without loosing validity.

J	Peirano, Pierre-Francois								Regulated, rebellious and control of thought: The "future war" and its consequences in The Time Trap (1962), Comic by Edgar P. Jacobs								BABEL-LITTERATURES PLURIELLES				38										2018	2018	In the central episode of The Time Trap (1962), Belgian cartoonist Edgar P. Jacobs depicted what the world would be in the year 5060, as one of his heroes, Professor Philip Mortimer, is travelling through time in a machine one of his rivals, craving for revenge, has invented and, then, deliberately tampered with. After a nuclear war devastated the planet in the late 21st century, it is now ruled over by a totalitarian government and this episode shows the consequences of a "war to come", which means regression for mankind as a whole. The influence of dystopian fiction works, like those by H.G. Wells, underpins the depiction of this nightmarish universe, along with the confiscation of technical progress by a handful of men and the spectre of a nuclear conflict looming ahead. However, Jacobs also takes advantage of this episode to convey a message of hope and a call for humanism, as shows the eventual victory of the "subjected" peoples, in which Mortimer plays a crucial part.

However, if the temperature is a good index for global biological processes, it is not for the chemical stability. In order to identify a reliable index, this work investigates water extraction coupled to spectroscopic indexes such as E-2/E-3, E-4/E-6, and SUVA(254) ratios, and fluorescence indexes such as Kalbitz, Milori, CP/PARAFAC, and Fluorescence Region Integration. The measurements of these indexes are carried out with six samples from different sites with different green waste material composition. The results show that most indexes depend on the green waste origin more than the composting time; some depend mostly on the material origin while others on compost age. A comparison of these results indicates that the biochemical process occurs more rapidly than expected by the compost producers. The combination of these indicators gives useful information on the processes that take place during composting.		[Abaker, M. G.; Mounier, S.] Univ Toulon & Var, MIO Lab, Toulon, France; [Abaker, M.

IEEE					An OFDM Testbed for LiFi Performance Characterization of Photovoltaic Modules								2018 GLOBAL LIFI CONGRESS (GLC)														2018	2018	OFDM-based wireless communications are widely used for digital data RF transmissions. This very efficient modulation scheme should prove to be one of the solutions for future VLC (visible light communications) systems. Moreover, for outdoor applications, photovoltaic modules seem to be interesting alternatives to photodiode-based classical detectors. They are indeed known to offer a higher level of resilience to saturation effects. In this article, we present LiFi performance results obtained from an OFDM-based LiFi testbed using various photovoltaic modules as photodetectors.

Indeed, it could help to refine rehabilitation programs for active participation during exercise therapy and to prevent musculoskeletal disorders. In this framework, the purpose of this study is to use artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the FFS of the upper-limb based on joint centre Cartesian positions and anthropometric data. Seventeen right upper-limb musculoskeletal models based on individual anthropometric data are created. For each musculoskeletal model, the FFS is computed for 8428 different postures. For any combination of force direction and joint positions, ANNs can predict the FFS with high values of coefficient of determination (R-2 > 0.89) between the true and predicted data.

The motivation behind this work is the shortages raised from the individual use of gaze based and SSVEP based wheelchair command techniques. The proposed framework is based on two modules : a gaze module to select command and activate the flashing stimuli. An SSVEP module to validate the selected command. An experimental protocol was set up and the prototype was tested on five paraplegic subjects. The results showed that the run accuracy reached an average of 98%. Navigation performance was assessed based on navigation time, obstacles collisions and optimal path deviation.

In the virtual reality domain, the sense of presence and co-presence, reflecting the psychological immersion of the user, is generally assessed through well-grounded subjective post-experience questionnaires. In this article, we aim at presenting a new way to automatically predict the sense of presence and co-presence of a user at the end of an interaction based on specific verbal and non-verbal behavioral cues automatically computed. A random forest algorithm has been applied on a human-agent interaction corpus collected in the specific context of a virtual environment developed to train doctors to break bad news to a virtual patient. The performance of the models demonstrate the capacity to automatically and accurately predict the level of presence and copresence, but also show the relevancy of the verbal and non-verbal behavioral cues as objective measures of presence.

In France, the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus is intensively harvested. Yet, the demography and population dynamics remained under-documented, particularly in Corsica. In this context, we have characterized the fluctuations in density of several size classes at 8 sites around the island, and assessed the genetic diversity and structuring of the population. Densities recorded lie between 0 and 2.18 (+/- 0.41) individuals.m(-2) and spatio-temporal variabilities have also been highlighted. The study of the influence of vegetation cover on the size classes suggests that small- and medium- sized individuals prefer substrates of intermediate heights, whereas individuals with a diameter >= 5 cm are more often observed on encrusting substrates, and may be responsible for the continuation of this type of benthic community. The genetic study indicates a high genetic diversity with a low genetic structuring. The N-e values obtained are similar to those described in previous papers. Due to estimates of local contemporary N-e and the homogeneous genetic diversity, our data tend to show that the Corsican population of P. lividus is not overexploited.

A focus is brought on robot drift-like faults on wheels and sensors. The goal is to detect and isolate the faulty component as early as possible. The proposed method is based on a combination of hardware redundancy and a bank of Extended Kalman Filters (EKF). Each filter is tuned for a specific fault, to generate residuals with different signatures under different component faults. The different signatures allow the fault isolation. Simulation results show that the proposed method allow to detect both wheels and sensors small drift-like faults and isolate them as early as possible.

It appears as a promising field for the theoretical study of numerous graphical models like Bayesian Networks or (Weighted) Constraint Networks, since it can ensure, under some hypothesis, the existence of polynomial time algorithms. This concept is also used in a wide range of applications. Recently, a real improvement in the practical computation of optimal tree decompositions has been observed, allowing new promising applications of this concept in real applications. In this paper, we first aim to analyze the real relevance of such optimal decompositions. We first set that a larger set of instances are now optimally decomposable in practice but using these algorithms on a practical level still constitutes a real difficulty. In a second time, we assess the impact of such optimal decompositions for solving these instances and note a discrepancy between the empirical results and what is expected from the complexity analysis. Finally, we discuss of the next investigations which are needed on this topic.

Following the 3D low Mach compressible Euler model previously developed and validated, a compressible fluid-structure interaction model is proposed. In the context of a fictitious domain, a volumic penalization is applied inside the body to ensure a rigidity constraint through a penalized velocity in order to get the correct motion of the rigid body. The accuracy of this simple model is improved using block-based adaptive mesh refinement technique. The improvement and the validity of our fluid-structure interaction procedure is investigated through the numerical simulation of the water entry of a cylinder freely falling and impacting the water. This test case is compared to experimental data and other numerical simulations.

J	Ettouati, Samuel								Residential migration of retirees in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region								REGION ET DEVELOPPEMENT					48			71	84					2018	2018	In 2013, 18,800 retirees from Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur moved and changed location within the region. By using individual data from the INSEE population census, this article highlights the different criteria of territorial attractiveness of seniors' mobility and their main residential trajectories within the region. The paper estimates a flow model stating the motivational differences in elderly mobility by age and level of education. Young retirees move long distances and rather locate in suburban areas. These territories allow retirees to access a better quality of life without breaking with their previous consumption habits, whether they come from the alpine departments or the metropolitan cores of Marseille, Nice or Toulon. At the same time, the Mediterranean coastline with high-end services and characterized by expensive land is accessible to the wealthiest pensioners only. Older retirees (aged 75 and older), who are at risk of dependency, are moving closer to metropolitan areas with accessible housing and dedicated infrastructure such as support or housing services. With the retirement of the baby-boom generation, the territorialized development of infrastructure dedicated to seniors appears as a factor of local attractiveness for retirees in the region and a challenge for regional planning.

The aim is to show that public image is built on discourses of and about the political actor. The political career of Francois Hollande, from candidate to president, enlights the differents aspects. The analysis focuses first on self-image elaboration, in and by his discourses and behavior. Then, how this image is also built by other locutors, whether they are allies or political opponents, citizen or media organizations : that are also important players in the elaboration of the political actor's public image. More precisely, some of the most important characteristics of Francois Hollande's image were developped and the way they were handled by differents speakers is analyzed : the "normal" president, his humour, his respects of people, and some negative judgment or compliment about him.

The method addresses a significant problem: we cannot presume that children have common knowledge about their rights or express themselves as an adult might. In our framework, a chatbot user begins a conversation, where based on the circumstance described, a neural network predicts both speech acts, relating to a dialogue graph, and legal types. Information is extracted in order to create a case for a legal advisor. In collaboration with the Children's Legal Centre Wales, who advocate for the improvement of legal rights in Wales, a corpus has been constructed and a prototype chatbot developed. The framework has been evaluated with classification measures and a user study.

J	Korabi, Taki Eddine; Graton, Guillaume; El Adel, El Mostafa; Ouladsine, Mustapha; Pinaton, Jacques			IEEE					An industrial risk-based indicator for dynamic sampling in semiconductor manufacturing								2018 UKACC 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL (CONTROL)								230	235					2018	2018	Uniform rate sampling is the easiest and most common sampling strategy used in the semiconductor industry. It consists of measuring every N products and is used for both regulated and unregulated steps. However, it is well-know that the sampling frequency has a direct impact on regulator performances making uniform rate sampling ineffective with the regulated steps. This paper proposes an indicator allowing the adaptation of the sampling frequencies taking into account the performances of the regulator and the industrial risk. The developed method offers better regulation performances, less measured products and leads to yield improvement and cycle time reduction. The approach is tested with real data provided by STMicroelectronics.

Thirty-five studies were selected and divided into three themes associated with representations of teachers as barriers to inclusion: 1) the inadequacy between inclusive policies and physical education programs, 2) the difficult collaboration between teachers and the partners of inclusion, and 3) the inadequacy of the initial and continual training of teachers in adapted physical education. A repercussion of this work is to propose training perspectives for physical education teachers to overcome these barriers.

Growth, stability and decomposition of Mg2Si ultra-thin films on Si (100)								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				427				522	527		10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.09.027			JAN 1 2018	2018	Using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy (STM/STS) and Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), we report an in-situ study of amorphous magnesium silicide (Mg2Si) ultra-thin films grown by thermally enhanced solid-phase reaction of few Mg monolayers deposited at room temperature (RT) on a Si(100) surface. Silicidation of magnesium films can be achieved in the nanometric thickness range with high chemical purity and a high thermal stability after annealing at 150 degrees C, before reaching a regime of magnesium desorption for temperatures higher than 350 degrees C. The thermally enhanced reaction of one Mg monolayer (ML) results in the appearance of Mg2Si nanometric crystallites leaving the silicon surface partially uncovered. For thicker Mg deposition nevertheless, continuous 2D silicide films are formed with a volcano shape surface topography characteristic up to 4 Mg MLs. Due to high reactivity between magnesium and oxygen species, the thermal oxidation process in which a thin Mg2Si film is fully decomposed (0.75 eV band gap) into a magnesium oxide layer (6-8 eV band gap) is also reported.

Morphometric characteristics of diazotrophic filamentous cyanobacteria are given, as well as the seasonal and inter-annual variations of their surface areas and integrated abundances. Trichodesmium tenue and T. thiebautii were the dominant species followed by T. erythraeum, altogether accounting for more than 51-80% of the biomass of the free-living filamentous cyanobacteria. Katagnymene spp. accounted for a smaller percentage (<13.8% at ocean stations, <3.6% in the lagoon). Richelia intracellularis biomass was relatively small (<1 % of total surface area and volume of Trichodesmium trichomes), with the highest concentration observed in summer (735 trichomes 1(-1)). Colonies of unidentified cyanobacteria composed of spherical cells accounted on average for <1 % of the Trichodesmium biomass, with maximum values exceeding 4000 cells 1(-1). Abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria varied according to environmental factors; summer 2001-2002 was characterized by low filamentous diazotroph abundance, and summer 2003, at the peak of the 2001-2003 El Nino, was particularly rich in filamentous cyanobacteria (with a maximum Trichodesmium spp. abundance of 4500 trichomes 1(-1) in the Loyalty Channel). A similar variability pattern was observed for large diatoms and dinoflagellates, and for all picoeukaryotic populations. Different biomass estimators are provided, including cell abundances, pigment concentrations including chlorophylls and phycoerythrin, and carbon content.

J	Hamdi, Takoua; Ben Ali, Jaouher; Di Costanzo, Veronique; Fnaiech, Farhat; Moreau, Eric; Ginoux, Jean-Marc								Accurate prediction of continuous blood glucose based on support vector regression and differential evolution algorithm								BIOCYBERNETICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING				38	2			362	372		10.1016/j.bbe.2018.02.005			2018	2018	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease requiring patients to know their blood glucose values in order to ensure blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Hence, the ability to predict blood glucose levels is of a great interest for clinical researchers. In this sense, the literature is rich with several solutions that can predict blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, these methods require the patient to specific their daily activities: meal intake, insulin injection and emotional factors, which can be error prone. To reduce this burden on the patent, this work proposes to use only continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to predict blood glucose levels independently of other factors. To support this, support vector regression (SVR) and differential evolution (DE) algorithms were investigated. The proposed method is validated using real CGM data of 12 patients. The obtained average of root mean square error (RMSE) was 9.44,10.78,11.82 and 12.95 mg/dL for prediction horizon (PH) respectively equal to 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. The results of the present study and comparison with some previous works show that the proposed method holds promise. The SVR based on DE algorithm achieved high prediction accuracy while being robustness, automatic, and requiring no human intervention.

This enables their survival and development in a wide range of contrasting environments. With the aim of highlighting specific metabolic shifts between these phenotypes and to improve the overall understanding of marine bacterial adhesion, a dual metabolomics/proteomics approach was applied to planktonic and biofilm cultures of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica TC8. The liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics study indicated that membrane lipid composition was highly affected by the culture mode: phosphatidylethanolamine (PEs) derivatives were over-produced in sessile cultures while ornithine lipids (OLs) were more specifically synthesized in planktonic samples. In parallel, differences between proteomes revealed that peptidases, oxidases, transcription factors, membrane proteins and the enzymes involved in histidine biosynthesis were over-expressed in biofilms while proteins involved in heme production, nutrient assimilation, cell division and arginine/ornithine biosynthesis were specifically up-regulated in free-living cells.

Four distinct coatings were tested at each site and season for one month. Metabarcoding showed biocidal coatings had less impact on eukaryotic assemblages compared to spatial and temporal effects. Ciliophora, Chlorophyceae or Cnidaria (mainly hydrozoans) were abundant at Lorient, whereas Arthropoda (especially crustaceans), Nematoda, and Ochrophyta dominated less diversified assemblages at Toulon. Seasonal shifts were observed at Lorient, but not Toulon. Metabolomics also showed clear site discrimination, but these were associated with a coating and not season dependent clustering. The meta-omics analysis enabled identifications of some associative patterns between metabolomic profiles and specific taxa, in particular those colonizing the plates with biocidal coatings at Lorient.

Samples were collected off the Sfax and Gabes-Ghannouch coasts. Concentrations in total resolved n-alkanes ranged from 0.03 to 3.2 mu g L-1, and concentrations in total parents + alkylated PAHs ranged from bdl to 108.6 ng L-1. The highest concentrations were recorded in the southern Sfax. AHs were mainly of biogenic origin with odd n-alkane predominance, although an anthropogenic contribution was also detected. The PAH molecular patterns revealed a mixed origin with the presence of low molecular weight and alkylated compounds, characteristic of uncombusted oil-derived products, and the presence of high molecular weight compounds, typical of combustion residues. Rainfall events induced an increase in PAH concentrations by a factor 1.5-23.5. The particle-water partition coefficients (K-oc) suggest that the partitioning of PAHs between the particulate and dissolved phases is driven by hydrophobicity and organic matter composition.

This advantage is manifested by the possibility to perform GaN based devices working in high voltage, high current, high frequency and high temperature conditions. However, despite these theoretical forecasts, trapping mechanisms limit the performances of the GaN based devices revealed by the so-called "drain current collapse". Our study is based on a methodology to understand trapping mechanisms in GaN metal-insulator-semiconductor high-electron mobility transistors. This work was achieved by means of electrical and optical characterization techniques such as Fourier transform deep level transient spectroscopy and photoluminescence. The activation energy and the apparent capture cross section of eight traps were extracted in normally-off (Ids=0A when Vgs=0V) AlGaN/GaN heterostructure technology used for power conversion. Six of these traps, E1=0.16eV, E2=0.31eV, E3=0.46eV, E4=0.5eV, E5=0.64eV and E6=0.79eV are electron traps located in the channel. An identification has been proposed for each trap. Two hole-like traps, H1=0.17eV and H2=0.74eV were assigned to the Mg and C doping of the GaN buffer layers, respectively. These traps might play a role in the current collapse which appears after the application of a large reverse voltage on the gate of the device. Furthermore, the results obtained using electrical and optical techniques allowed concluding that oxygen atoms and dislocations are incorporated in GaN layers during the growth.

Thus, the coatings containing nanofillers are expected to have significant barrier properties for corrosion protection and reduce the trend for the coating to blister or delaminate. On the other hand, high hardness could be obtained for metallic coatings by producing the hard nanocrystalline phases within a metallic matrix. This article presents a review on recent development of nanocomposite coatings, providing an overview of nanocomposite coatings in various aspects dealing with the classification, preparative method, the nanocomposite coating properties, and characterization methods. It covers potential applications in areas such as the anticorrosion, antiwear, superhydrophobic area, self-cleaning, antifouling/antibacterial area, and electronics.

They account for about 40% of marine primary productivity and particulate carbon exported to depth as part of the biological pump. Diatoms have long been known to be abundant in turbulent, nutrient-rich waters, but observations and simulations indicate that they are dominant also in meso- and submesoscale structures such as fronts and filaments, and in the deep chlorophyll maximum. Diatoms vary widely in size, morphology and elemental composition, all of which control the quality, quantity and sinking speed of biogenic matter to depth. In particular, their silica shells provide ballast to marine snow and faecal pellets, and can help transport carbon to both the mesopelagic layer and deep ocean. Herein we show that the extent to which diatoms contribute to the export of carbon varies by diatom type, with carbon transfer modulated by the Si/C ratio of diatom cells, the thickness of the shells and their life strategies; for instance, the tendency to form aggregates or resting spores. Model simulations project a decline in the contribution of diatoms to primary production everywhere outside of the Southern Ocean. We argue that we need to understand changes in diatom diversity, life cycle and plankton interactions in a warmer and more acidic ocean in much more detail to fully assess any changes in their contribution to the biological pump.

Previous work has investigated several types of pre- and post-retrieval query performance predictors; the latter has been shown to be more effective. In this paper we investigate the use of features that were initially defined for learning to rank in the task of QPP. While these features have been shown to be useful for learning to rank documents, they have never been studied as query performance predictors. We developed more than 350 variants of them based on summary functions. Conducting experiments on four TREC standard collections, we found that Letor-based features appear to be better QPP than predictors from the literature. Moreover, we show that combining the best Letor features outperforms the state of the art query performance predictors. This is the first study that considers such an amount and variety of Letor features for QPP and that demonstrates they are appropriate for this task.

Practical realizations with nanostructures suffer from two intrinsic deficiencies: narrow absorption widths and low radiative efficiencies. We evaluate in this paper the theoretical efficiency expectations with respect to those two properties, and consider in addition the possibility of including an electronic ratchet. We observe that an intermediate band solar cell using a ratchet becomes highly tolerant to non-ideal nanostructures, so that any combination of low absorption and low radiative efficiency becomes compatible with optimized performances above the Shockley-Queisser limit. We conclude that future practical realization may take advantage of quantum wells, which have been less considered so far than quantum dots, due to relatively higher nonradiative recombination rates. Such realizations would take advantage of the higher absorption properties of quantum wells.

We consider a single sensor (e.g., LIDAR, stereo-video, etc.) mounted on a fixed offshore structure and remotely measuring fields of free surface elevations. Assuming a uniform distribution of measurement points over the sensor aperture angles, the density of free surface observation points geometrically decreases with the distance from the sensor. Additionally, wave shadowing effects occur, which become more important at small viewing angles (i.e., grazing incidence on the surface). These effects result in observations of surface elevation that are sparsely distributed. Here, based on earlier work by [1], we present and discuss the characteristics of an algorithm, aimed at assimilating such sparse data and able to deterministically reconstruct and propagate ocean surface elevations for their prediction in time and space. This algorithm could assist in the automatic steering and control of a variety of surface vehicles. Specifically, we compare prediction results using linear wave theory and the weakly nonlinear Choppy Wave Model [2, 3], extended here to an "improved" second order formulation. The latter model is based on an efficient Lagrangian formulation of the free surface and was shown to be able to model wave properties that are important to the proper representation of nonlinear free surfaces, namely wave shape and celerity. Synthetic datasets from highly nonlinear High Order Spectral simulations are used as reference oceanic surfaces. Predicted results are analyzed over an area that evolves in time, using the theoretical amount of information assimilated during the reconstruction of the wave field. For typical horizons of prediction, we discuss the capabilities of our assimilation process for each wave model considered.

One of the answers lies in the optimal utilization of energy by manufacturing processes. In this paper, we attempt to obtain a partially "sustainable" reconfigurable manufacturing system, by considering the greenhouse gases emission (GHG) as a criterion in addition to the traditional two criteria, respectively, cost and time. In order to do so, we propose a hybrid multi-objective approach, combining the strengths of MOILP 'Multi-Objective Integer Linear Programming' and the evolutionary algorithm AMOSA 'Archived Multi-Objective Simulated-Annealing' to solve the process plan generation problem of an RMS. More specifically, three criteria are considered, respectively, the total production cost, the completion time and the amount of GHG emitted during the product manufacturing. To illustrate the applicability of the developed approach, a simple example is presented and the numerical results analyzed.

In this paper, a modified Non-threaded Run-to-Run approach is proposed. This approach permits the control of the maximum possible number of equipment simultaneously. The idea is to model the entire system with all possible combinations (threads) in a novel state space representation (SSR) so that we can increase the rank of the controllability matrix. Due to its efficiency, especially with a SSR, a Kalman filter is used as an estimator for the Run-to-Run control purpose. The accuracy of the proposed method is tested using real data derived from the deposition area of STMicroelectronics foundry in Rousset.

Following its development, a new challenging area in the field of artificial intelligence has been opened and an accurate prediction method of blood glucose levels has been targeted by scientific researchers. This article proposes a new method based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for blood glucose level prediction of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) using only CGM data as inputs. To show the efficiency of our method and to validate our ANN, real CGM data of 13 patients were investigated. The accuracy of the strategy is discussed based on some statistical criteria such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The obtained averages of RMSE are 6.43 mg/dL, 7.45 mg/dL, 8.13 mg/dL and 9.03 mg/dL for Prediction Horizon (PH) respectively 15 min, 30 min, 45 min and 60 min and the average of MAPE was 3.87% for PH = 15 min, knowing that the smaller is the RMSE and MAPE, the more accurate is the prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed ANN is accurate, adaptive, and very encouraging for a clinical implementation. Furthermore, while other studies have only focused on the prediction accuracy of blood glucose, this work aims to improve the quality of life of T1D patients by using only CGM data as inputs and by limiting human intervention.

Most of the systems developed in this field are based on supervised machine learning techniques and need a high amount of annotated data, nevertheless not many resources can be found due to their high cost of preparation. In this paper we present an analysis of a recently published dataset, covering different subtasks, which are aspect extraction, category detection, and sentiment analysis. It contains book reviews published in Amazon, which is a new domain of application in absa literature. The annotation process and its characteristics are described, as well as a comparison with other datasets.

We prove that knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map determines uniquely and even Holder-stably the magnetic field and the electric potential.

Nonnegative matrix factorization of spectrograms is a case in point in audio signal processing. However, this low-rank prior is not straightforwardly related to complex matrices obtained from a short-time Fourier - or discrete Gabor - transform (STFT), which is generally defined from and studied based on a modulation operator and a translation operator applied to a so-called window. This paper is a first study of the low-rankness property of time-frequency matrices. We characterize the set of signals with a rank-r (complex) STFT matrix in the case of a unit hop size and frequency step with few assumptions on the transform parameters. We discuss the scope of this result and its implications on low-rank approximations of STFT matrices.

This is made possible by the peculiar power-law behavior of the tunneling rates in the chiral Luttinger liquid theory, which allow to approximate the typical infinite sums of the photoassisted transport formalism in a simple and particularly convenient way.

RMS is required to be more robust, flexible and reconfigurable, which makes machine layout problem a key step to fulfill such design. Thus, any proposed layout needs to be changeable and easily redesigned. In this paper, we consider the machine layout problem in reconfigurable context. We develop an exhaustive search based heuristic to solve it. To propose the best respective machine layout, the heuristic considers various constraints from the manufacturing environment, and the initial generated process plan for the designed RMS under performance metrics. The proposed layout must at its best, respects both the constraints imposed by the generated process plan and those depicting the available location in the shop floor where machines are going to be placed. An illustrative numerical example is proposed to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

The underlying motivation was to extend Morse theory to several functions, i.e. to find a Morse theory for m differentiable functions defined on a manifold M of dimension l. We use this framework to take a 2 x 2 Hamiltonian H = H (p) is an element of C-infinity(T*R-2) to its normal form near a singular point of the Fresnel surface. Namely we say that H has the Pareto property if it decomposes, locally, up to a conjugation with regular matrices, as H (p) = u'(p)C(p)(u'(p))*, where u : R-2 -> R-2 has singularities of codimension 1 or 2, and C(p) is a regular Hermitian matrix ("integrating factor"). In particular this applies in certain cases to the matrix Hamiltonian of Elasticity theory and its (relative) perturbations of order 3 in momentum at the origin.

The formation of layered morphologies, prevalently oriented in the direction parallel to the membrane surface, is responsible of the decay in fuel cell operation conditions. Nafion membranes are annealed at 140 degrees C over 7 days in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a proton-acceptor solvent. The important increase of mechanical stability is related to the formation of a crystalline phase, which acts as a physical cross linker. The procedure is followed by hydrothermal annealing in liquid water in order to obtain an optimal water uptake at equilibrium (tailor made). To better understand the behavior of these polymers, we use the INCA method (lonomer n(c) Analysis) and compare with dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The stabilized materials are proposed for use in intermediate temperature fuel cells, where the mechanical stabilization by the annealing procedure plays a fundamental role.

Design/methodology/approach In total, 28 semi-structured in-depth interviews with managers in France were conducted, transcribed and analyzed. Findings The findings reveal three distinct strategies. First, the authors identified a flexibility within the rules strategy in which managers try to accommodate religious practices by making allowances, create mutual understanding and trust. Second, a separation strategy emerged in which managers keep work and religion clearly separated. Those managers expressed a strong adherence to rules and perceived the implementation of allowances difficult not only for their own organization but also in light of third parties with whom they worked. Third, the findings reveal a common-ground strategy in which managers stressed the communalities between individual workers, downplayed their differences and sought to create a strong corporate culture to which all employees could relate. Practical implications The expression of religious beliefs in the workplace is increasing. However, little is known about how managers deal with the perceived clash of secularism and the presence of different religions in the workplace. Implications for managers such as taking into account perceptions of justice, practical issues as well as the importance of communication and education are discussed. Originality/value Religion is a deep-level and understudied aspect of diversity management that deserves more attention given the increase in religious diversity in the workplace.

Several properties of this function - a function of three non-necessarily integral weights or of three multiplets of real eigenvalues for the associated Horn problem - are already known. In the integral case it can be thought of as a semi-classical approximation of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We prove that it may be expressed as a local average of a finite number of such coefficients. We also relate this function to the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials (stretching polynomials) i.e. to the Ehrhart polynomials of the relevant hive polytopes. Several SU(n) examples, for n = 2, 3, . . ., 6, are explicitly worked out.

PetriBaR is a package of functions devoted to basic Petri net analysis (including the computation of T-invariants, siphons, reachability graph, etc.), monitor design, reachability analysis, state estimation, fault diagnosis, and opacity verification. In particular, the functions for reachability analysis, state estimation, fault diagnosis, and opacity verification exploit the construction of the Basis Reachability Graph to avoid the exhaustive enumeration of the reachable set, thus leading to significant advantages in terms of computational complexity. All functions of PetriBaR are introduced in detail clarifying the syntax to be used to run them. Finally, they are illustrated via a series of numerical examples. PetriBaR is available online for public access. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It describes both explicit argumentative forms (conflicting points of view, interlocutive and interdiscursive dialogism) and implicit ones, through what Grize called schematizations. Focusing on the study of several poems (by Rimbaud, Jaccottet, Michaux, Grosjean, Gaspar), it pays a particular attention to argumentation dealing with literature itself (through burlesque and pastiche), and to epidictic texts seeking for expressivity or obliterating their speaker. The close connection between formal choices and thematic contents in poetry shows that it tightly links ethics with aesthetics, a feature that the analyst should take into account.

Thereby, we aimed to determine whether the gait characteristics of active elderly persons practicing Nordic walking are more similar to healthy adults than that of the sedentary elderly. Comparison was made based on parameters computed from three inertial sensors during walking at a freely chosen velocity. Results showed differences in gait pattern in terms of the amplitude computed from acceleration and angular velocity at the lumbar region (root mean square), the distribution (Skewness) quantified from the vertical and Euclidean norm of the lumbar acceleration, the complexity (Sample Entropy) of the mediolateral component of lumbar angular velocity and the Euclidean norm of the shank acceleration and angular velocity, the regularity of the lower limbs, the spatiotemporal parameters and the variability (standard deviation) of stance and stride durations. These findings reveal that the pattern of active elderly differs significantly from sedentary elderly of the same age while similarity was observed between the active elderly and healthy adults. These results advance that regular physical activity such as Nordic walking may counteract the deterioration of gait quality that occurs with aging.

The database used in this research was Espacenet and the INPI, with about 90 million registered documents. Were found 616 documents related to assistive technologies in a period of 15 years, from 2000 to 2015. Specifically, the results revealed that the application of assistive technologies for physical and visual disabilities are concentrated in four classes of patents involving (A61G5) "chairs or personal transport specially adapted for disabled patients or disabled" (A61H3) "devices to help disabled people to move around," (A61G7) "beds and devices for lifting patients or disabled" and (A61F2) "prostheses and artificial substitutes for body parts". It was also established that China is the key country in the registration of patents relating to the application of assistive technology and, in addition, is also the country that centralizes most of the inventors and depositors.

Several approaches has been proposed to minimize the sensor error as the Particle filter (PF) which has gain a popularity with nonlinear and non-gaussian noise system models. In the case of orientation estimation and positioning the PF has been employed in the frame of hybridization with other measurement systems such as visual systems, radio-localisation, GPS etc. In this study, we propose to use only the data obtained from inertial sensor, with a constrained PF. The Iterative Mean Density Truncation algorithm (IMeDeT) has been employed with a quaternion algorithm based on acceleration and magnetic field. An improvement in term of accuracy has been clearly detected as well as the filter convergence, against the Extended Kalman Filer (EKF)and an optical measurement system.

Video smoke detection is applied on many surveillance and security applications. Smoke detection method should have a high detection rate to have a strong detector of smoke detection. Deep Belief Network which is a stacked layers of Restricted Boltzman Machine is the technique that we used for smoke detection. This technique extracts and classify smoke and no smoke regions simultaneously. The effectiveness of our implemented smoke detection method is evaluated after calculating smoke detection rate, time of pre-traing and time of fine-tuning. The higher is the detection rate the better is the smoke method and the lowest is the time of pre-training and fine-tuning the speeder is the method for smoke detection.

The cost functional is defined by the solution of the controlled backward stochastic differential equation, at the initial time. Our goal is to find an optimal control which minimizes the cost functional. The method consists to construct a sequence of approximating controlled systems for which we show the existence of a sequence of feedback optimal controls. By passing to the limit, we establish the existence of a relaxed optimal control to the initial problem. The existence of a strict control follows from the Filippov convexity condition.

While previous research works focused on belief revision, belief merging, and belief contraction, the problem of belief update within fragments of classical logic has not been addressed so far. In the context of revision, it has been proposed to refine existing operators so that they operate within propositional fragments, and that the result of revision remains in the fragment under consideration. This approach is not restricted to the Horn fragment but also applicable to other propositional fragments like Krom and affine fragments. We generalize this notion of refinement to any belief change operator. We then focus on a specific belief change operation, namely belief update. We investigate the behavior of the refined update operators with respect to satisfaction of the KM postulates and highlight differences between revision and update in this context.

J	Abedini, Javad; Peridy, Nicolas								Is there an economic rationale for leaving or joining the EU? Evidence from a political economy framework								ECONOMICS BULLETIN				38	2			772	+					2018	2018	Over the past few years, European Citizens have become increasingly skeptical of the EU and its institutions. The recent Brexit is a striking illustration of this trend. This questions the rationale and the relevance of European Integration. In this paper, we rely on the median voter approach to identify the driving forces behind the binary choice of economic integration in the EU and to estimate the relevance of such integration for the EU as a whole and for each country pair. Our model is based on the political-economy framework while it also accounts for recent developments such as the interdependence effects (Baier et al. 2014) and imperfect competition (Baier and Bergstrand, 2004). From this theoretical basis, we develop a conditional fixed-effect logit model. The model relates the relative utility for economic integration to various observables, such as differences of countries in factor endowments and technology, to estimate the likelihood of economic integration in the EU. Our database includes the partners of all effective economic integration agreements in the world, i.e. 105 countries (10,920 country pairs), from 1981-2013. Results show that the probability for economic integration in Europe overall is equal to 82.6%. It is even greater for most Western EU countries and most country pairs. Thus, these results suggest that economic integration is generally very relevant for EU countries, including Great Britain.

This device captures holograms and reconstructs a double image, one for the intensity and another for the phase. Depending on the used objective lens (20x or 50x) and the microshell diameter, several hundred or thousand pictures must be taken to cover both hemispheres (1170 pictures for a 2200-mu m-diameter capsule). A specific handling system using two rotation axes has been developed to acquire automatically all 3-D hemispherical data without any manipulation. A new version of the 3-D surface rebuilding (using images stitching) and analyzing software is used to characterize (diameter and height measurement) and to localize individual defects, such as bumps or pits. Using a new version of the dedicated software, the pictures are filtered and stitched together to perform a 3-D surface mapping of the capsule. Postprocessing routines are able to detect defects and to sort them out. Specific tools are also dedicated to the characterization of polishing defects, such as concave or clustered defects. In addition to this, a study of the DHM metrology capabilities, including a comparison with a calibrated atomic force microscope, has been led.

In this context, some case studies of combined instrumental approaches, involving X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Raman spectroscopy, integrated by infrared thermography (IRT), are, in particular, discussed: the archaeological site of Scifi (Forza d'Agro, province of Messina, Italy) and the Abbey of SS. Pietro e Paolo d'Agro (Casalvecchio Siculo, province of Messina, Italy). In the first case, the elemental composition, as obtained by XRF, of two types of mortars belonging to two different chronological phases, dated back between the 3rd and the 5th century AD, allowed us to hypothesize a same origin area of their raw materials and a different production technique. Again, the combined use of XRF and Raman spectroscopies, supported by IRT technique, on pottery fragments of Greek-Hellenistic age and late imperial period, furnished important information concerning the receipts for the pigmenting agents of the finishing layer, allowing in some cases their unambiguous identification. In the second case, XRF data collected on bricks and stones from the external facade of the abbey allowed us to make some hypothesis concerning the provenance of their constituents materials, supposed to be in the area of valley of the river Agro.

The numerical solution is obtained by a combined finite element-finite volume method based on the linear Crouzeix-Raviart finite element for the velocity and piece wise constant approximation for the density. The convective terms are approximated using upwinding. The distance between a numerical solution of the compressible problem and the strong solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is measured by means of a relative energy functional. For barotropic pressure exponent gamma >= 3/2 and for well-prepared initial data we obtain uniform convergence of order O(root Delta t, h(a,) epsilon), alpha = min{2 gamma-3/gamma, 1}. Extensive numerical simulations confirm that the numerical solution of the compressible problem converges to the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations as the discretization parameters Delta t, h and the Mach number epsilon tend to zero.

Empirical studies on the self-insurance motive suggest that high-reserves economies are more resilient to financial crises and to international capital inflows volatility. They show also that pre-crisis foreign reserve accumulation explains post-crisis growth. However, some papers suggest that the relationship between international reserves holding and reduced vulnerability is nonlinear, meaning that reserve holding is subject to diminishing returns. This article devotes more attention to the potential nonlinear relationship between the foreign reserves holding and macroeconomic resilience to shocks. For a sample of nine emerging economies, we assess to what extent the accumulation of international reserves allows to mitigate negative impacts of external shocks on the output gap. While a major part of the literature focuses on the global financial crisis, we investigate this question by considering two sub-periods: 1995-2003 and 2004-2013. We implement threshold VAR model in which the structure is allow to change if the threshold variable crosses a certain estimated threshold. We find that the effectiveness of reserve holding to improve the resilience of domestic economies to shocks has increased over time. Hence, the diminishing returns of foreign reserve holding stressed in the previous literature must be qualified.

Here, we explore the role of life-history strategies of sessile marine species in shaping restoration outcomes and their associated timescales. A transplantation experiment for the extremely slow-growing and threatened octocoral Corallium rubrum was highly successful over a relatively short term due to high survival and reproductive potential of the transplanted colonies. However, demographic projections predict that from 30 to 40 years may be required for fully functional C. rubrum populations to develop. More broadly, a comprehensive meta-analysis revealed a negative correlation between survival after transplanting and growth rates among sessile species. As a result, simulated dynamics for a range of marine sessile invertebrates predict that longer recovery times are positively associated with survival rates. These results demonstrate a tradeoff between initial transplantation efforts and the speed of recovery. Transplantation of slow-growing species will tend to require lower initial effort due to higher survival after transplanting, but the period required to fully recover habitat complexity will tend to be far longer. This study highlights the important role of life history as a driver of marine restoration outcomes and shows how demographic knowledge and modeling tools can help managers to anticipate the dynamics and timescales of restored populations.

In the present study we investigated the effects of this anthropisation on the spatial distribution of copepod assemblages in relation to the physicochemical features of seawater at 20 stations sampled on 19 March 2013. Copepods represented 73% of total zooplankton abundance. Small planktonic copepods (<1.45 mm), including pollution-tolerant species (e.g. Oithona nana, Paracalanus parvus, Harpacticus littoralis and Tisbe battagliai), proliferated exclusively in stations of similar to 0.5-m depth characterised by high coastal anthropogenic inputs. The largest copepod species were dominated by Calanus helgolandicus (1.45-2.5 mm) in the offshore zone in depths of similar to 3 m. Substantial numbers of Oithona plumifera (7.5%) were found at depths between 0.5 and 3 m. Copepod diversity was significantly higher in the southern zone, which is less affected by sewage, than in the northern zone, which was subjected to higher pressure (Shannon-Wiener index H' = 1.5-2.5 and <= 1.5 bits individual(-1)). A shift in the planktonic copepod community between the two zones was linked to deterioration of water quality, with higher phosphorus levels, turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the northern zone.

Complexation between nickel and the N-(4-vinylbenzyl)-2-(aminomethyl)pyridine (Vbamp) monomer was studied in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and in a DMSO-methanol mixture (50:50, v/v) at 80 degrees C using a Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O salt as the nickel source. According to the results, the three nickel/Vbamp complexes could be selectively obtained using specific conditions: for [Ni(Vbamp)(3)](2+) the Ni/Vbamp ratio in DMSO was 1.08, for [Ni(Vbamp)(2)](2+) the Ni/Vbamp ratio DMSO-methanol (50:50, v/v) was 0.49 and for [Ni(Vbamp)(3)](2+) the Ni/Vbamp ratio in DMSO was 0.3. Ion-imprinted polymers (IIPs) were prepared either with [Ni(Vbamp)] (NO3)(2), [Ni(Vbamp)(2)](NO3)(2), or [Ni(Vbamp)(3)](NO3)(2) complexes as the template. IIP with a [Ni(Vbamp)(3)](2+) complex, isolated by precipitation prior to polymerization, was also prepared. The results demonstrated that surface properties, nickel binding and selectivity properties were similar for both kind of IIPs - prepared by in situ complexation or isolation of the complex prior to polymer synthesis.

We show that while unable to ferment glucose, this bacterium is able to couple its oxidation to reduction of elemental sulfur. We demonstrate furthermore that M. prima strain PhosAc3 as well as M. prima strain MesG1 and Mesotoga infera are able to grow in syntrophic association with sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) acting as hydrogen scavengers through interspecies hydrogen transfer. Hydrogen production was higher in M. prima strain PhosAc3 cells co-cultured with SRB than in cells cultured alone in the presence of elemental sulfur. We propose that the efficient sugar-oxidizing metabolism by M. prima strain PhosAc3 in syntrophic association with a hydrogenotrophic sulfate-reducing bacterium can be extrapolated to all members of the Mesotoga genus. Genome comparison of Thermotogae members suggests that the metabolic difference between Mesotoga and Thermotoga species (sugar oxidation versus fermentation) is mainly due to the absence of the bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase in the former. Such an obligate oxidative process for using sugars, unusual within prokaryotes, is the first reported within the Thermotogae. It is hypothesized to be of primary ecological importance for growth of Mesotoga spp. in the environments that they inhabit.

While recent research has shown its importance in the degradation of terrestrial particulate OM (TPOM), the mechanisms involved in the induction of autoxidation in estuaries remain unclear. In this study, we propose for the first time the involvement of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity in the induction of autoxidation in mixed waters. The observation of unusual profiles of palmitoleic acid oxidation products and the presence of jasmonic acid in suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected close to the Rhone River, as well as in samples from the Mackenzie and Amazon rivers, is attributed to strong LOX activity. We show the role played by salinity in the induction of this LOX activity and provide an explanation for the differences in estuarine autoxidation level. At high latitude, lower temperatures and irradiance favor photooxidative damage to higher plant debris and, consequently, hydroperoxide production. High hydroperoxide content strongly contributes to LOX activation in mixed waters. The high resulting LOX activity enhances alkoxyl radical production and thus autoxidation. On the contrary, at low latitude, photooxidative effects are limited, and riverine autoxidation is favored. The higher hydroperoxide content of TPOM may, as a consequence, thereby also contribute to a high level of LOX activity and autoxidation in estuaries. In temperate zones, land and riverine photooxidative and autoxidative damage is limited, unlike estuaries where we observed significant LOX-induced and autoxidative damage. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we present one algorithm that does not exploit the information of where the image is corrupted, and others that do it. While the first algorithm is able to reconstruct only images that our visual system is still capable of recognize, we show that those of the second type completely transcend such limitation providing reconstructions at the state-of-the-art in image inpainting. This can be interpreted as a validation of the fact that our visual cortex actually encodes the first type of algorithm.

IEEE					Design of new Sensory Soft Hand: combining air-pump actuation with superimposed curvature and pressure sensors								2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFT ROBOTICS (ROBOSOFT)								164	169					2018	2018	This paper presents the design of a new sensory soft hand that can be adapted to the wrists of small humanoids like the NAO robot. The fingers of the hand can act as a gripper thanks to air pump actuation. The innovation resides in the internal face of each finger which is equipped with a superimposition of four piezo resistive sensors and one curvature sensor. Thanks to this multi-layered arrangement of sensors, it is possible to estimate the curved shape of the fingers and the amount of pressure that is exerted by the object grasped by the hand. The combination of forces and deformation measurements resulting from the interaction of the gripper with external objects is essential for the quality of the grasp, and even allows to estimate properties of the object. In addition to usual advantages of soft grippers like mechanical compliance, shock resistance, and lightweight, this gripper is simple to manufacture, low cost and easy to fit.

IEEE					In-Memory and Error-Immune Differential RRAM Implementation of Binarized Deep Neural Networks								IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting														2018	2018	RRAM-based in-Memory Computing is an exciting road for implementing highly energy efficient neural networks. This vision is however challenged by RRAM variability, as the efficient implementation of in-memory computing does not allow error correction. In this work, we fabricated and tested a differential HfO2-based memory structure and its associated sense circuitry, which are ideal for in-memory computing. For the first time, we show that our approach achieves the same reliability benefits as error correction, but without any CMOS overhead. We show, also for the first time, that it can naturally implement Binarized Deep Neural Networks, a very recent development of Artificial Intelligence, with extreme energy efficiency, and that the system is fully satisfactory for image recognition applications. Finally, we evidence how the extra reliability provided by the differential memory allows programming the devices in low voltage conditions, where they feature high endurance of billions of cycles.

Fast Approximation of Centrality and Distances in Hyperbolic Graphs								Lecture Notes in Computer Science				11346				3	18		10.1007/978-3-030-04651-4_1			2018	2018	We show that the eccentricities (and thus the centrality indices) of all vertices of a delta-hyperbolic graph G = (V, E) can be computed in linear time with an additive one-sided error of at most c delta, i.e., after a linear time preprocessing, for every vertex v of G one can compute in O(1) time an estimate (e) over cap (v) of its eccentricity ecc(G)(v) such that ecc(G)(v) <= (e) over cap (v) <= ecc(G)(v)+ c delta for a small constant c. We prove that every delta-hyperbolic graph G has a shortest path tree, constructible in linear time, such that for every vertex v of G, ecc(G)(v) <= ecc(T) (v) <= ecc(G)(v)+c delta. We also show that the distance matrix of G with an additive one-sided error of at most c'delta can be computed in O(vertical bar V vertical bar(2) log(2) vertical bar V vertical bar) time, where c' < c is a small constant. Recent empirical studies show that many real-world graphs (including Internet application networks, web networks, collaboration networks, social networks, biological networks, and others) have small hyperbolicity.

Unfortunately, such basic information is often only partially available for professional stakeholders, teachers, scientists and citizens, and often incomplete for ecosystems that possess the highest diversity. In this context, an ultimate ambition is to set up innovative information systems relying on the automated identification and understanding of living organisms as a means to engage massive crowds of observers and boost the production of biodiversity and agro-biodiversity data. The LifeCLEF 2018 initiative proposes three data-oriented challenges related to this vision, in the continuity of the previous editions, but with several consistent novelties intended to push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art in several research directions. This paper describes the methodology of the conducted evaluations as well as the synthesis of the main results and lessons learned.

In this paper, we define a highly expressive ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) security model for the MQTT protocol. Our model allows us to regulate not only publications and subscriptions but also distribution of messages to subscribers. We can express various types of contextual security rules, (temporal security rules, content-based security rules, rules based on the frequency of events etc.).

We formulate two convex optimization problems to jointly learn the metric and the classifier or regressor in kernel feature spaces. An iterative three-step multi-view metric learning algorithm is derived from the optimization problems. In order to scale the computation to large training sets, a blockwise Nystrom approximation of the multi-view kernel matrix is introduced. We justify our approach theoretically and experimentally, and show its performance on real-world datasets against relevant state-of-the-art methods.

Interest in high contrast homogenization is growing rapidly but assumptions are generally made in order to remain in the framework of classical elasticity. On the contrary, we obtain homogenized energies taking into account second gradient (i.e., strain gradient) effects. We first show that we can reduce the study of the considered structures to discrete systems corresponding to frame lattices. Our study of such lattices differs from the literature in the fact that we take into account the different orders of magnitude of the extensional and flexural stiffnesses. This allows us to consider structures which would have been floppy when considering only extensional stiffness and completely rigid when considering flexural stiffnesses of the same order of magnitude than the extensional ones. To our knowledge, this paper provides the first rigorous homogenization result in continuum mechanics with a complete second gradient limit energy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of overweight and obesity and the contribution of body fat mass index (BFMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) to body mass index (BMI) changes among young male rugby players (15-a-side rugby). Methods: The criteria of the International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity from BMI. The method of skinfold thickness was used to assess percentage of body fat (%BF), BFMI, and FFMI. Excess body fat was defined by using BFMI and %BF above the 75th percentile. Data were grouped according to the age categories of the French Rugby Federation (U11, under 11 years; U13, under 13 years; U15, under 15 years) and to BMI status (NW normal-weight versus OW/OB overweight/obese). Results: Overall, 32.8% of the young players were overweight, and 13.8% were obese. However, 53% of young players classified as obese and overweight by BMI had an excess body fat by using BFMI above the 75th percentile. FFMI increased significantly between U11 and U13 in both groups, without significant change in BMI and BFMI. Both groups had similar significant gains in BMI and FFMI between U13 and U15, while BFMI only increased significantly in OW/OB (+ 18.5%). The strong correlations between BMI and %BF were systematically lower than those between BMI and BFMI. FFMI was strongly or moderately associated with BFMI. Conclusions: Chart analysis of BFMI and FFMI could be used to distinguish changes in body composition across age categories in young male rugby players classified as normal-weight, overweight, and obese by BMI.
