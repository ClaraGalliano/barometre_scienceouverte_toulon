J	Jimenez, Jose Beltran; Rubiera-Garcia, Diego; Saez-Gomez, Diego; Salzano, Vincenzo								Cosmological future singularities in interacting dark energy models								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				94	12					123520	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.123520			DEC 21 2016	2016	The existence of interactions between dark matter and dark energy has been widely studied, since they can fit well the observational data and may provide new physics through such an interaction. In this work, we analyze these models and investigate their potential relation with future cosmological singularities. We find that every future singularity found in the literature can be mapped into a singularity of the interaction term, that we call the Q singularity, where the energy flow between the dark components diverges. Furthermore, this framework allows us to identify a new type of future singularity induced by the divergence of the first derivative of the dark energy equation of state parameter.

The aim of the present study is to propose a mathematical model incorporating kinetics of growth, consumption of substrates, product formations, and inhibition by hydrogen in order to predict hydrogen production depending on defined culture conditions. Results: Our mathematical model, incorporating data concerning growth, substrates, and products, was developed to predict hydrogen production from batch fermentations of the hyperthermophilic bacterium, T. maritima. It includes the inhibition by hydrogen and the liquid-to-gas mass transfer of H-2, CO2, and H2S. Most kinetic parameters of the model were obtained from batch experiments without any fitting. The mathematical model is adequate for glucose, yeast extract, and thiosulfate concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 20 mmol/L, 0.2-0.5 g/L, or 0.01-0.06 mmol/L, respectively, corresponding to one of these compounds being the growth-limiting factor of T. maritima. When glucose, yeast extract, and thiosulfate concentrations are all higher than these ranges, the model overestimates all the variables. In the window of the model validity, predictions of the model show that the combination of both variables (increase in limiting factor concentration and in inlet gas stream) leads up to a twofold increase of the maximum H-2-specific productivity with the lowest inhibition. Conclusions: A mathematical model predicting H-2 production in T. maritima was successfully designed and confirmed in this study. However, it shows the limit of validity of such mathematical models. Their limit of applicability must take into account the range of validity in which the parameters were established.

J	Boileau, Celine; Auria, Richard; Davidson, Sylvain; Casalot, Laurence; Christen, Pierre; Liebgott, Pierre-Pol; Combet-Blanc, Yannick								Hydrogen production by the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima part I: effects of sulfured nutriments, with thiosulfate as model, on hydrogen production and growth								BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS				9						269	10.1186/s13068-016-0678-8			DEC 19 2016	2016	Background: Thermotoga maritima and T. neapolitana are hyperthermophile bacteria chosen by many research teams to produce bio-hydrogen because of their potential to ferment a wide variety of sugars with the highest theoretical H-2/glucose yields. However, to develop economically sustainable bio-processes, the culture medium formulation remained to be optimized. The main aim of this study was to quantify accurately and specifically the effect of thiosulfate, used as sulfured nutriment model, on T. maritima growth, yields and productivities of hydrogen. The results were obtained from batch cultures, performed into a bioreactor, carefully controlled, and specifically designed to prevent the back-inhibition by hydrogen. Results: Among sulfured nutriments tested, thiosulfate, cysteine, and sulfide were found to be the most efficient to stimulate T. maritima growth and hydrogen production. In particular, under our experimental conditions (glucose 60 mmol L-1 and yeast extract 1 g L-1), the cellular growth was limited by thiosulfate concentrations lower than 0.06 mmol L-1. Under these conditions, the cellular yield on thiosulfate (Y X/Thio) could be determined at 3617 mg mmol(-1). In addition, it has been shown that the limitations of T. maritima growth by thiosulfate lead to metabolic stress marked by a significant metabolic shift of glucose towards the production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). Finally, it has been estimated that the presence of thiosulfate in the T. maritima culture medium significantly increased the cellular and hydrogen productivities by a factor 6 without detectable sulfide production. Conclusions: The stimulant effects of thiosulfate at very low concentrations on T. maritima growth have forced us to reconsider its role in this species and more probably also in all thiosulfato-reducer hyperthermophiles. Henceforth, thiosulfate should be considered in T. maritima as (1) an essential sulfur source for cellular materials when it is present at low concentrations (about 0.3 mmol g(-1) of cells), and (2) as both sulfur source and detoxifying agent for H-2 when thiosulfate is present at higher concentrations and, when, simultaneously, the pH(2) is high. Finally, to improve the hydrogen production in bio-processes using Thermotoga species, it should be recommended to incorporate thiosulfate in the culture medium.

This allows to compute a one-to-one Hough transform, every point in the image space voting for one unique point in the parameter space. Moreover, those parameters can be directly estimated on the greyscale image without the need to calculate the contour and without reducing the spatial support of the Hough transform, i.e. densely on the whole image. The general framework using multiscale derivatives is presented, and the one-to-one Hough dense transforms for detecting lines and circles are evaluated and compared with other variants of Hough transforms, from qualitative and computational points of view.

Fourteen OPEs were analyzed in 115 aerosol phase samples collected from the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans during the MALASPINA circumnavigation campaign. OPEs were detected in all samples with concentrations ranging from 360 to 4400 pg m(-3) for the sum of compounds. No clear concentration trends were found between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The pattern was generally dominated by tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), although tri-nbutyl phosphate (TnBP) had a predominant role in samples close to continents and in those influenced by air masses originating in continents. The dry deposition fluxes of aerosol phase Sigma 14OPE ranged from 4 to 140 ng m(-2) d(-1). An estimation of the OPE gas phase concentration and gross absorption fluxes by using three different sets of physical chemical properties suggested that the atmosphere-ocean diffusive exchange of OPEs could be 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than dry deposition. The associated organic phosphorus inputs coming from diffusive OPE fluxes were estimated to potentially trigger up to 1.0% of the reported primary production in the most oligotrophic oceanic regions. However, the uncertainty associated with these calculations is high and mostly driven by the uncertainty of the physical chemical properties of OPEs. Further constraints of the physical chemical properties and fluxes of OPEs are urgently needed, in order to estimate their environmental fate and relevance as a diffusive source of new organic phosphorus to the ocean.

In this context, optimization of growth and lipid production by the marine oleaginous V-2-strain-microalgae is of great interest as it contains large amounts of mono-unsaturated (MUFAs) and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Methods: In this study, the isolated V-2 strain was identified based on 23S rRNA gene. Growth and lipid production conditions were optimized by using the response surface methodology in order to maximize its cell growth and lipid content that was quantified by both flow cytometry and the gravimetric method. The intracellular lipid bodies were detected after staining with Nile red by epifluorescence microscopy. The fatty acid profile of optimal culture conditions was determined by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector. Results: The phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses showed that the strain V-2 was affiliated to Tetraselmis genus. The marine microalga is known as an interesting oleaginous species according to its high lipid production and its fatty acid composition. The optimization process showed that maximum cell abundance was achieved under the following conditions: pH: 7, salinity: 30 and photosynthetic light intensity (PAR): 133 mu mol photons. m(-2). s(-1). In addition, the highest lipid content (49 +/- 2.1% dry weight) was obtained at pH: 7, salinity: 37.23 and photosynthetic light intensity (PAR): 188 mu mol photons. m(-2). s(-1). The fatty acid profile revealed the presence of 39.2% and 16.1% of total fatty acids of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), respectively. Omega 3 (omega 3), omega 6 (omega 6) and omega 9 (omega 9) represented 5.28%, 8.12% and 32.8% of total fatty acids, respectively. Conclusions: This study showed the successful optimization of salinity, light intensity and pH for highest growth, lipid production and a good fatty acid composition, making strain V-2 highly suitable for food and nutraceutical applications.

In the present paper, the transformation ('lift') of the Vlasov-Maxwell bracket induced by the dynamical reduction of single-particle dynamics is investigated when the reduction is carried out by Lie-transform perturbation methods. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide an explicit pathway to the Hamiltonian formulations for the guiding-centre and gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations, which have found important applications in our understanding of turbulent magnetized plasmas. Here, it is shown that the general form of the reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equations possesses a Hamiltonian structure defined in terms of a reduced Hamiltonian functional and a reduced bracket that automatically satisfies the standard bracket properties.

One corresponds to cold ions and the other to far sub-ion scales. By including the electron pressure dynamics, these models improve the Hall reduced magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the kinetic Alfven wave model of Boldyrev et al. (2013 Astrophys. J., vol. 777, 2013, p. 41), respectively. We show that the two models can be obtained either within the gyrofluid formalism of Brizard (Phys. Fluids, vol. 4, 1992, pp. 1213-1228) or as suitable weakly nonlinear limits of the finite Larmor radius (FLR)-Landau fluid model of Sulem and Passot (J. Plasma Phys., vol 81, 2015, 325810103) which extends anisotropic Hall MHD by retaining low-frequency kinetic effects. It is noticeable that, at the far sub-ion scales, the simplifications originating from the gyroaveraging operators in the gyrofluid formalism and leading to subdominant ion velocity and temperature fluctuations, correspond, at the level of the FLR-Landau fluid, to cancellation between hydrodynamic contributions and ion finite Larmor radius corrections. Energy conservation properties of the models are discussed and an explicit example of a closure relation leading to a model with a Hamiltonian structure is provided.

In its simplest formulation, the model requires the knowledge of the first three moments of the line-of-sight pairwise velocity distribution plus two well-defined dimensionless parameters. The model is obtained by extending the Gaussian-Gaussianity prescription for the velocity distribution, developed in a previous paper, to a more general concept allowing for local skewness, which is required to match simulations. We compare the model with the well-known Gaussian streaming model and the more recent Edgeworth streaming model. Using N-body simulations as a reference, we show that our model gives a precise description of the redshift-space clustering over a wider range of scales. We do not discuss the theoretical prescription for the evaluation of the velocity moments, leaving this topic to further investigation.

Here, we tested how much the depth-stratified prokaryotic communities were influenced by such an event, and also by the following re-stratification. The deep convection event (0-1500 m) that occurred in winter 2010-2011 in the NW Mediterranean Sea resulted in a homogenization of the prokaryotic communities over the entire convective cell, resulting in the predominance of typical surface Bacteria, such as Oceanospirillale and Flavobacteriales. Statistical analysis together with numerical simulation of verti-cal homogenization evidenced that physical turbulence only was not enough to explain the new distribution of the communities, but acted in synergy with other parameters such as exported particulate and dissolved organic matters. The convection also stimulated prokaryotic abundance (121%) and heterotrophic production (143%) over the 0-1500 m convective cell, and resulted in a decline of cell-specific extracellular enzymatic activities (267%), thus suggesting an intensification of the labile organic matter turnover during the event. The rapid re-stratification of the prokaryotic diversity and activities in the intermediate layer 5 days after the intense mixing indicated a marked resilience of the communities, apart from the residual deep mixed water patch.

As interpreted, transformations of short-scale wind waves by horizontal current gradients are responsible for those spectacular observations. Those observations could prove particularly useful to validate numerical ocean models that reach increasingly high resolutions. Focusing on surface roughness at optical wavelengths, two steps have recently been performed in that direction. First, it was shown in a previous paper by Rascle et al. that surface roughness variations not only trace surface current divergence but also other characteristics of the current gradient tensor, mainly the strain in the wind direction. The wind direction with respect to the current gradient thus stands out as an important interpretative parameter. The second step is the purpose of the present paper, where the effect of the viewing direction is investigated. To this end, the authors discuss pairs of quasi-simultaneous sun-glitter images, taken from different satellite positions, to provide different viewing configurations, namely, quasi-orthogonal azimuth angles at similar zenith angles. As evidenced, upwind and crosswind viewing observations can be markedly different. As further confirmed with idealized numerical simulations, this anisotropy well traces anisotropic surface current areas, while more isotropic contrasts likely trace areas dominated by surface divergence conditions. These findings suggest the potential to directly separate divergence from other deformations by using high resolution roughness observations at multiple azimuth view angles.

This paper outlines the deep convection of winter 2012-2013 and the meteorological conditions that produced it. Alternating phases of mixing and restratification are related to periods of high and low heat losses, respectively. High-resolution, realistic, three-dimensional models are essential for assessing the intricacy of buoyancy fluxes, horizontal advection, and convective processes. At the submesoscale, vertical velocities resulting from symmetric instabilities of the density front bounding the convection zone are crucial for ventilating the deep ocean. Finally, concomitant atmospheric and oceanic data extracted from the comprehensive SOP2 data set highlight the rapid, coupled evolution of oceanic and atmospheric boundary layer characteristics during a strong wind event.

J	Molin, Bernard; Remy, Fabien; Arnaud, Gwendoline; Rey, Vincent; Touboul, Julien; Sous, Damien								On the dispersion equation for linear waves traveling through or over dense arrays of vertical cylinders								APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH				61				148	155		10.1016/j.apor.2016.10.001			DEC 2016	2016	Sloshing tests are performed on a rectangular tank filled with bottom-mounted vertical cylinders. The cylinders, in regular staggered arrangements, are first emergent then shortened to be fully submerged. Different porosities are achieved by varying the number of cylinders. The tank undergoes forced horizontal motion at frequencies around the natural frequency of the first sloshing mode. The free surface elevation and the hydrodynamic loads are measured. When resonance is attained, it means that the wavelength is exactly twice the length of the tank and that this wavelength and the sloshing frequency are related by a specific dispersion equation. From literature several theoretical dispersion equations are proposed in the emergent and submerged cases. New dispersion equations are offered based on the cylinder cluster being considered as an anisotropic porous medium. The latter ones provide the best agreement with the experimental results.

Patents apply to a wide variety of uses, and this is expanding. The increasing kinds of users of patent documents result in a lack of educational programs regarding this matter. This paper describes Patent2Net (P2N) a patentinformatic suite whose purpose is to fill the lack in the academic world (education and research) of a tool to use with students (STEM, Masters, PhD), by valuation services and for defining corpuses for research in general patent analysis, specifically on textual content. P2N is a free open-source modular, scalable, customizable and derivable tool, written in the python language. We present here the main functions of the tool and the technical aspects after discussing the skills to be reached by students for state of the art patent analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gruet, Mathieu; Peyre-Tartaruga, Leonardo Alexandre; Mely, Laurent; Vallier, Jean-Marc								The 1-Minute Sit-to-Stand Test in Adults With Cystic Fibrosis: Correlations With Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test, 6-Minute Walk Test, and Quadriceps Strength								RESPIRATORY CARE				61	12			1620	1628		10.4187/respcare.04821			DEC 2016	2016	BACKGROUND: Exercise testing is part of the regular assessment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We aimed to evaluate (1) the convergent validity of the 1-min sit-to-stand (STS) test in CF by investigating its relationships with peak oxygen uptake (peak V-O2), quadriceps strength, and quality of life and (2) to compare these associations with those of the 6-min walk test (6MWT). METHODS: Twenty-five adults with CF (FEV1 = 59 +/- 24%) performed the STS test, the 6MWT, quadriceps strength assessment, and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Physical activity level, quality of life, and self-esteem were assessed by questionnaires. RESULTS: STS repetitions, 6-min walk distance, quadriceps strength, and peak V-o2 were, respectively, 71 12,0 10, 93 29, and 62 +/- 16% of predicted. The STS test had moderate associations with peak V-o2 (r = 0.56, P =.004), quadriceps strength (r = 0.52, P =.008), and some questionnaire items (eg, perceived physical strength, r = 0.67, P <.001) only when repetitions were expressed as a product of body weight. Overall, these associations were weaker than those obtained from 6-min walk distance x weight. Oxygen desaturation during the STS test was strongly associated with oxygen desaturation during CPET (r = 0.80, P <.001). Peak heart rate was lower during the STS test as compared with CPET (P <.001) and the 6MWT (P =.009). CONCLUSIONS: The STS test cannot be used as a replacement for, CPET to accurately assess peak exercise capacity in CF. The STS test may have utility in detecting patients with CF who may exhibit a high level of oxygen desaturation during heavy exercise. Further studies should identify the factors contributing to STS performance to confirm the potential interest of STS repetitions x body weight outcome as a useful submaximal exercise parameter in CF.

The long-run analysis reveals that rising temperatures and inappropriate working tools reduce olive output in semi-arid areas. Therefore, we propose an appropriate training for workers to develop their skills and a public policy subsidizing the innovation of used capital stock, at least in the southern regions. We propose to encourage the development of drought-tolerant olive trees - especially in the south of Tunisia, where global warming has caused a severe drought.

We investigate the topological structure changes in the phase space of energetic particles with respect to the magnetic one. For this study, cylindrical magnetic fields with non-monotonic safety factors that induce the magnetic internal transport barrier are considered. We show that the topological structure of the magnetic field line and of the particle trajectories can be quite different. We explain this difference using the concept of an effective particle q-profile. Using this notion, we can investigate the location and existence of resonances for particle orbits that are different from the magnetic ones. These are examined both numerically by integrating an equation of motion and theoretically by the use of Alfven's guiding center theory and by the use of an effective reduced Hamiltonian for the integrable unperturbed system. It is clarified that, for the energetic particles, the grad B drift effect shifts the resonances and the drift induced by curvature of the magnetic field line leads to the vanishing of the resonances. As a result, we give two different mechanisms that lead to the creation of transport barriers for energetic particles in the region where the magnetic field line is chaotic.

Perceived exertion responses and performance of two mode of propulsion in the multistage field test with wheelchair basketball players								SCIENCE & SPORTS				31	6			E181	E188		10.1016/j.scispo.2016.08.002			DEC 2016	2016	Purpose. -This study aims to comparing, performance and perceived exertion of the synchronous versus asynchronous mode of wheelchair propulsion within the framework of a Wheelchair progressive aerobic field test. Materials and method. - Eight highly trained wheelchair basketball players have performed an incremental multistage field test in two separate sessions (synchronous and asynchronous). The number of exercise levels performed, maximal aerobic velocity, rating of perceived exertion and arm frequency were measured. Results. -The number of exercise levels performed and maximal aerobic velocity are significantly increased in the synchronous mode (P< 0.05) and arm frequency is significantly higher in synchronous versus asynchronous at 100% maximal aerobic velocity. There is a significant correlation between both modes of propulsion for the number of exercise levels performed (r(2) = 0.80). However, normalized rating of perceived exertion values at each maximal aerobic velocity percentage shows no significant difference whatever the mode of propulsion, even if the absolute value of rating of perceived exertion tends to be higher in asynchronous versus synchronous at each stages. Conclusion. -Synchronous mode provides better performance than asynchronous, in terms of number of exercise levels performed and maximal aerobic velocity. Arm frequency could restrict athletes' performance in asynchronous propulsion during the final stage. It would be interesting for futures studies to assess both physiological and biomechanical parameters simultaneously. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

This paper explores Schwartz's - theory to understand the sports value system of 20 boxers aged 14 to 20. These athletes took part in a semi-structured interview to assess the values they strive for and continue to hold in their practice. The results show that the values of "success in sports," "security" and "conformity" are mentioned the most, in contrast to "hedonism" and "power." They provide an empirical argument for using Schwartz's theory to study athletes' sports values. Coaches are urged to take account of young - athletes' priority values to improve their training methods and sports performance.

In particular, the Benamou-Brenier formula characterizes the square of the Wasserstein distance W (2) as the infimum of the kinetic energy, or action functional, of all vector fields transporting one measure to the other. Another important property of the Wasserstein distances is the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality, stating the equality between the distance W (1)(mu, nu) of two probability measures mu, nu and the supremum of the integrals in d(mu - nu) of Lipschitz continuous functions with Lipschitz constant bounded by one. An intrinsic limitation of Wasserstein distances is the fact that they are defined only between measures having the same mass. To overcome such a limitation, we recently introduced the generalized Wasserstein distances , defined in terms of both the classical Wasserstein distance W (p) and the total variation (or L (1)) distance, see (Piccoli and Rossi in Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis 211(1):335-358, 2014). Here p plays the same role as for the classic Wasserstein distance, while a and b are weights for the transport and the total variation term. In this paper we prove two important properties of the generalized Wasserstein distances: (1) a generalized Benamou-Brenier formula providing the equality between and the supremum of an action functional, which includes a transport term (kinetic energy) and a source term; (2) a duality A la Kantorovich-Rubinstein establishing the equality between and the flat metric.

Hydrothermal impacts on trace element and isotope ocean biogeochemistry								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES				374	2081					20160035	10.1098/rsta.2016.0035			NOV 28 2016	2016	Hydrothermal activity occurs in all ocean basins, releasing high concentrations of key trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) into the oceans. Importantly, the calculated rate of entrainment of the entire ocean volume through turbulently mixing buoyant hydrothermal plumes is so vigorous as to be comparable to that of deep-ocean thermohaline circulation. Consequently, biogeochemical processes active within deep-ocean hydrothermal plumes have long been known to have the potential to impact global-scale biogeochemical cycles. More recently, new results from GEOTRACES have revealed that plumes rich in dissolved Fe, an important micronutrient that is limiting to productivity in some areas, are widespread above mid-ocean ridges and extend out into the deep-ocean interior. While Fe is only one element among the full suite of TEIs of interest to GEOTRACES, these preliminary results are important because they illustrate how inputs from seafloor venting might impact the global biogeochemical budgets of many other TEIs. To determine the global impact of seafloor venting, however, requires two key questions to be addressed: (i) What processes are active close to vent sites that regulate the initial high-temperature hydrothermal fluxes for the full suite of TEIs that are dispersed through non-buoyant hydrothermal plumes? (ii) How do those processes vary, globally, in response to changing geologic settings at the seafloor and/or the geochemistry of the overlying ocean water? In this paper, we review key findings from recent work in this realm, highlight a series of key hypotheses arising from that research and propose a series of new GEOTRACES modelling, section and process studies that could be implemented, nationally and internationally, to address these issues. This article is part of the themed issue ` Biological and climatic impacts of ocean trace element chemistry'.		[German, C.

The goal of our study was to develop a method for identifying and quantifying UEDs of products that have a high environmental impact use phase. In this paper, we studied the case of different usages of a vacuum cleaner and their environmental consequences. We first conducted a survey to gather information on how people use the product Then, we conducted experimentations to measure the consequences of the usages. We also explored how the testers responded to feedback inviting them to adopt a more sustainable behaviour. Results show that most of the users do not use the product optimally and cause additional environmental impact Several usage ecodrifts were identified, causing both abnormal energy overconsumption and wear and tear of the product The calculations show that Delayed Environmental Impacts, because their consequence is the early replacement of the whole product, are of much greater importance than Real-time Environmental Impacts.

Here we describe TolR, a hybrid two-component system (HTCS), from the beta-proteobacterium Azoarcus sp. strain CIB that degrades c-di-GMP in response to aromatic hydrocarbons, including toluene. This response protects cells from toluene toxicity during anaerobic growth. Whereas wild-type cells tolerated a sudden exposure to a toxic concentration of toluene, a tolR mutant strain or a strain overexpressing a diguanylate cyclase gene lost viability upon toluene shock. TolR comprises an N-terminal aromatic hydrocarbon-sensing Per-Arnt-Sim ( PAS) domain, followed by an autokinase domain, a response regulator domain, and a C-terminal c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain. Autophosphorylation of TolR in response to toluene exposure initiated an intramolecular phosphotransfer to the response regulator domain that resulted in c-di-GMP degradation. The TolR protein was engineered as a functional sensor histidine kinase (TolRSK) and an independent response regulator (TolRRR). This classic two-component system (CTCS) operated less efficiently than TolR, suggesting that TolR was evolved as a HTCS to optimize signal transduction. Our results suggest that TolR enables Azoarcus sp. CIB to adapt to toxic aromatic hydrocarbons under anaerobic conditions by modulating cellular levels of c-di-GMP. This is an additional role for c-di-GMP in bacterial physiology.

For such emissions, it has been shown the interest in implementing "mismatched" correlators, reducing both the zero Doppler contribution (ZDC) masking effects and the false alarm rate. A very efficient mismatched reference signal is obtained with the reciprocal filter (or inverse filter) which consists in a modulus frequential equalization of the transmitted signal. We propose here to revisit the reciprocal filter-based correlator and to reinterpret it as a so-called Doppler channel detector (CHAD). This new interpretation allows a direct rejection of the ZDC, unifying in one and the same step the main disturbance mitigation and the detector construction. We provide a statistical theoretical study of the performance and a comparison with the matched correlator, i.e., the classical cross-ambiguity function (CAF). We demonstrate that CHAD has a random pedestal (a clutter floor level) significantly lower than that of the classical CAF for low Doppler frequency shifts. Numerical experiments on simulated and real data as well validate the mathematical derivations.

The ion-imprinted polymer and its corresponding non-imprinted polymer were tested for their nickel retention capacity over a wide range of concentration at pH 4.0 and 7.0. Their selectivity was also checked with various Ni/Co and Ni/Zn ratios at pH 4.0 and 7.0. It was shown that even in strongly disfavoring conditions (high excess of competitor), the IIP's selectivity remained performing. This original broad retention study allowed the determination of the variations of the selectivity factors according to the increasing presence of competitors, a clearly innovative approach. The efficiency of the polymers in natural samples from Saimaa Lake (Lappeenranta, Finland) and Mediterranean Sea (Toulon, France) was also assessed. Finally, the whole dataset was simultaneously modelled using a software usually dedicated to the determination of natural ligand's binding properties. The modelling using different kinds of binding sites (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) allowed the precise determination of the synthesized polymers' structure and binding ability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The latter assume homogeneous mixing within schools, workplaces and households, mostly for the lack of detailed information on human contact behaviour within these settings. The recent data availability on high-resolution face-to-face interactions makes it now possible to assess the goodness of this simplified scheme in reproducing relevant aspects of the infection dynamics. Methods: We consider empirical contact networks gathered in different contexts, as well as synthetic data obtained through realistic models of contacts in structured populations. We perform stochastic spreading simulations on these contact networks and in populations of the same size under a homogeneous mixing hypothesis. We adjust the epidemiological parameters of the latter in order to fit the prevalence curve of the contact epidemic model. We quantify the agreement by comparing epidemic peak times, peak values, and epidemic sizes. Results: Good approximations of the peak times and peak values are obtained with the homogeneous mixing approach, with a median relative difference smaller than 20 % in all cases investigated. Accuracy in reproducing the peak time depends on the setting under study, while for the peak value it is independent of the setting. Recalibration is found to be linear in the epidemic parameters used in the contact data simulations, showing changes across empirical settings but robustness across groups and population sizes. Conclusions: An adequate rescaling of the epidemiological parameters can yield a good agreement between the epidemic curves obtained with a real contact network and a homogeneous mixing approach in a population of the same size. The use of such recalibrated homogeneous mixing approximations would enhance the accuracy and realism of agent-based simulations and limit the intrinsic biases of the homogeneous mixing.

At equilibrium, we find that this quantity, called mixed noise, is linked to the thermoelectric ac conductance by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Out of equilibrium, we discuss its spectrum and find evidence of the close relationship between the mixed noise and the thermopower. We study the spectral coherence and identify the conditions to have a strong correlation between the electrical and heat currents. The change in the spectral coherence due to the presence of a temperature gradient between the reservoirs is also highlighted.

Lie-algebroid morphisms, therefore, allow one to relate different versions of the brackets that correspond to the same spacetime structure. An application to examples of modified brackets found mainly in models of loop quantum gravity can, in some cases, map the spacetime structure back to the classical Riemannian form after a field redefinition. For one type of quantum corrections (holonomies), signature change appears to be a generic feature of effective spacetime, and it is shown here to be a new quantum spacetime phenomenon which cannot be mapped to an equivalent classical structure. In lowcurvature regimes, our constructions not only prove the existence of classical spacetime structures assumed elsewhere in models of loop quantum cosmology, they also show the existence of additional quantum corrections that have not always been included.

We examine here these models, analyzing their ability to fit cosmological data using robust model comparison criteria. Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and acoustic scale information from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been used. We find that SNIa data either alone or combined with BAO can be well reproduced by both Lambda CDM and power law expansion models with n similar to 1.5, while the constant expansion rate model (n = 1) is clearly disfavored. Allowing for some redshift evolution in the SNIa luminosity essentially removes any clear preference for a specific model. The CMB data are well known to provide the most stringent constraints on standard cosmological models, in particular, through the position of the first peak of the temperature angular power spectrum, corresponding to the sound horizon at recombination, a scale physically related to the BAO scale. Models with n >= 1 lead to a divergence of the sound horizon and do not naturally provide the relevant scales for the BAO and the CMB. We retain an empirical footing to overcome this issue: we let the data choose the preferred values for these scales, while we recompute the ionization history in power law models, to obtain the distance to the CMB. In doing so, we find that the scale coming from the BAO data is not consistent with the observed position of the first peak of the CMB temperature angular power spectrum for any power law cosmology. Therefore, we conclude that when the three standard probes (SNIa, BAO, and CMB) are combined, the Lambda CDM model is very strongly favored over any of these alternative models, which are then essentially ruled out.

Agardh, are habitat-forming species dominating several benthic assemblages from the littoral fringe down to 70-80 m depth in the clearest waters. They generate high primary production involved in the maintenance of diversified trophic levels, they provide shelter, food, habitat and nursery areas to many species, and they are long-lived species that constitute a good model for studying human impact on species diversity. Cystoseira crinita Duby is a Mediterranean endemic cespitose species, living in shallow waters (0-5 m depth), in places with little wave action and high solar irradiance. To reconstruct the long-term patterns of change in its distribution along the French Mediterranean coast (French Catalonia, Languedoc, Provence, French Riviera and Corsica), all the historical data (published articles, unpublished reports and herbarium vouchers) collected since the 18th century were searched and analysed. To assess the current status of the species, several field surveys were conducted between 2010 and 2016 by snorkelling and SCUBA diving. Cystoseira crinita is currently extinct in French Catalonia, near-extinct in Languedoc and western Provence, and functionally extinct on the French Riviera coast, while the eastern Provence and Corsican populations have remained stable. The main probable causes of decline are habitat destruction and overgrazing by herbivores. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.		[Blanfune, A.; Boudouresque, C.

However, the horizon bounds large spacelike hypersurfaces. A compelling geometric perspective on the evolution of the interior geometry was recently shown to be provided by a generally covariant definition of the volume inside a black hole using maximal surfaces. In this article, we expand on previous results and show that finding the maximal surfaces in an arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetime is equivalent to a 1 + 1 geodesic problem. We then study the effect of Hawking radiation on the volume by computing the volume of maximal surfaces inside the apparent horizon of an evaporating black hole as a function of time at infinity: while the area is shrinking, the volume of these surfaces grows monotonically with advanced time, up to when the horizon has reached Planckian dimensions. The physical relevance of these results for the information paradox and the remnant scenarios are discussed.

A linear kinematic model based on the spatio-temporal evolution of the frequency is derived, predicting the focusing distance and time of a chirped wave packet in the presence of constant vorticity. Furthermore, a linear model, based on a Fourier integral, is used to describe the evolution of the free surface on shearing current. To compute the fully nonlinear evolution of the wave group in the presence of vorticity, a new numerical model, based on a BIEM approach, is developed. On the basis of these different approaches, the role of constant vorticity on rogue wave occurrence is analysed. Two main results are obtained: (1) the linear behaviour expected in the presence of constant vorticity is significantly different from what is commonly expected in the presence of constant current and (2) the nonlinear effects are found to be of significant influence in the case at hand.

To do this, we used a new original analysis of spatial econometrics to take into account in an efficient and finely manner the spatial effects, individual and temporal effects of the spatial autocorrelation. This analysis was done on the basis of global spatial autocorrelation test and the spatial autoregressive model (SAR) as well as the spatial Durbin model (SDM). It appears from our results that the available water in the groundwater table of the governorate i can be an effective solution for the farmer who resides there provided that the means are implemented so that he can benefit. Our robustness results based on the cointegration dynamic panel data, also shows the effect of temperature via the hydric resources of the governorate i and that the neighboring governorates represent a negative spillover effect.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY				53	11			1732	1738		10.1111/psyp.12732			NOV 2016	2016	Intrinsic motivation (IM) is often viewed as a spontaneous tendency for action. Recent behavioral and neuroimaging evidence indicate that IM, in comparison to extrinsic motivation (EM), solicits the motor system. Accordingly, we tested whether IM leads to greater excitability of the motor cortex than EM. To test this hypothesis, we used two different tasks to induce the motivational orientation using either words representing each motivational orientation or pictures previously linked to each motivational orientation through associative learning. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex was applied when viewing the stimuli. Electromyographic activity was recorded on the contracted first dorsal interosseous muscle. Two indexes of corticospinal excitability (the amplitude of motor-evoked potential and the length of cortical silent period) were obtained through unbiased automatic detection and analyzed using a mixed model that provided both statistical power and a high level of control over all important individual, task, and stimuli characteristics. Across the two tasks and the two indices of corticospinal excitability, the exposure to IM-related stimuli did not lead to a greater corticospinal excitability than EM-related stimuli or than stimuli with no motivational valence (ps>.20). While these results tend to dismiss the advantage of IM at activating the motor cortex, we suggest alternative hypotheses to explain this lack of effect, which deserves further research.

More than 7 Gbit of SRAM memories manufactured in CMOS bulk 40 nm technology have been subjected to the natural radiation background. The intensity of the atmospheric neutron flux has been continuously measured on site during these experiments using dedicated neutron monitors. As the result, the neutron and alpha component of the soft error rate (SER) have been very accurately extracted from these measurements, refining the first SER estimations performed in 2012 for this SRAM technology. Data obtained at sea level evidence, for the first time, a possible correlation between the neutron flux changes induced by the daily atmospheric pressure variations and the measured SER. Finally, all of the experimental data are compared with results obtained from accelerated tests and numerical simulation.		[Autran, J. L.; Munteanu, D.; Moindjie, S.; Saoud, T.

Our method is to use inducing techniques for all points except 0 and its preimages, extending a recent result Haydn (2014), and then to deal with the remaining points separately. The preimages of 0 are dealt with applying recent results in Aytac (2015). The point zeta = 0 is studied separately because the tangency with the identity map at this point creates too much dependence, which causes severe clustering of exceedances. The Extremal Index, which measures the intensity of clustering, is equal to 0 at zeta = 0, which ultimately leads to a degenerate limit distribution for the partial maxima of stochastic processes arising from the dynamics and for the usual normalising sequences. We prove that using adapted normalising sequences we can still obtain non-degenerate limit distributions at zeta = 0. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dispersing silanized BaTiO3 nanopowder under ultrasonic and stir, nanocomposites of epoxy-amine matrix with different morphologies are obtained. The nanoparticles silane functionalization containing amine end groups effectively improve the compatibility of the nano-BaTiO3 and the epoxy matrix. Storage modulus, glass transition temperature, tensile and flexural properties of nanocomposites and dielectric properties are increased until 10% by weight of nano-BaTiO3 loading, well dispersed in the matrix. Above 10 wt.% of nano-BaTiO3, scanning electronic microscopy and thermal analysis showed that agglomeration of nanoparticles occurs. Rheological and mechanical nanocomposites properties were evaluated and matrix occlusion behaviors were identified. In light of the specific behavior of the occluded polymer, the dielectric properties, especially dielectric loss are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most of the primary production of the P. oceanica meadow is not directly consumed by herbivores and plays a role as dead rhizomes and roots, dead leaves and drift epibionts (hereafter necromass). The fate of this necromass is (i) sequestration within the matte, (ii) consumption by detritus-feeders within the meadow, (iii) export towards other marine ecosystems, where it constitutes a source for food webs, (iv) export towards beaches, where it constitutes banquettes, reduces the impact of waves and contributes to the beach ecosystem, and (v) export towards the terrestrial dune ecosystem. These five stocks can exchange necromass. The ecosystem services of the P. oceanica necromass are pivotal. For example, the role of P. oceanica banquettes is fundamental in protecting beaches from erosion, and the carbon sequestration within the matte contributes to the mitigation of emissions of CO2. Human impact on each of these stocks can affect the other stocks and their ecosystem services. The removal of banquettes from beaches can have a dramatic negative impact on P. oceanica ecosystem services, including the sustaining of beaches. The erosion of matte due to trawling and anchoring can remobilize the sequestrated carbon stock.

Its behaviour in the Var region can strongly condition the downstream flow along the Gulf of Lions shelf and Spain coast, making this zone a key area. However, the sub-mesoscale dynamics of the area and its potential impacts on the rest of the flow are not well known. This work reveals the potential interest of better simulating high-resolution dynamics in a restricted area and how this could improve the circulation representation in a larger area. To address this question, a very high resolution configuration (1/192(ay)) nested in an already existing high-resolution configuration (1/64(ay)) has been developed, using the NEMO model. Comparisons with observations show that the very high-resolution changes only weakly the mean NC characteristics but can significantly modify individual mesoscale events such as eddies and meanders occurring in the zoomed area. Furthermore, the coastal dynamics and episodic intrusions of a NC secondary branch inside a semi-enclosed bay appear to be significantly enhanced. In a second stage, the assessment of the feedback of this improved dynamics on the regional mesoscale dynamics is shown, this being allowed by the two-way coupling option of the embedded configuration using AGRIF.

The temporal variation of the coastal seascape is obtained from biogeochemical and hydrosedimentary models, the ocean-atmosphere radiance is obtained from the water and atmosphere radiative transfer model. The GeoOCAPI images are simulated with 400-m resolution, 18 spectral bands with associated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and with 1-h acquisition frequency, on the Gulf of Lion (Marseille, France) during a pollution event caused by the urban outfall of Cortiou in Marseille. These images describe the water color dynamic in the Gulf of Lion due to the river transport and the urban outfall. The validation with real medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) images showed that the image simulator was reliable with an average relative error (RE) at 4.76% for visible bands and at 16.51% for near infrared bands. The quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) inversion method was tested. The suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can be retrieved with good accuracy; the error is, respectively, 7.69% and 12.21%. The chlorophyll concentration (chl) is misestimated (58.10%) due to the low concentration in this area (< 1 mg . m(-3)) compared to SPM (> 1g . m(-3)). The study showed that the future geostationary sensor GeoOCAPI will be able to monitor the water composition in coastal areas through the day and detect and monitor an urban outfall discharge.

Our results are essentially based on in situ data (mooring, research vessel, glider, and profiling float) collected from a multiplatform and integrated monitoring system (MOOSE: Mediterranean Ocean Observing System on Environment), which monitored continuously the northwestern Mediterranean Sea since 2007, and in particular high-frequency potential temperature, salinity, and current measurements from the mooring LION located within the convection region. From 2009 to 2013, the mixed layer depth reaches the seabed, at a depth of 2330m, in February. Then, the violent vertical mixing of the whole water column lasts between 9 and 12 days setting up the characteristics of the newly formed deep water. Each deep convection winter formed a new warmer and saltier vintage of deep water. These sudden inputs of salt and heat in the deep ocean are responsible for trends in salinity (3.30.2 x 10(-3)/yr) and potential temperature (3.20.5 x 10(-3) C/yr) observed from 2009 to 2013 for the 600-2300 m layer. For the first time, the overlapping of the three phases of deep convection can be observed, with secondary vertical mixing events (2-4 days) after the beginning of the restratification phase, and the restratification/spreading phase still active at the beginning of the following deep convection event.

This method is applied to a gold nanowire during its mechanical loading using the tip of an atomic force microscope. During the loading process, such a sample is `accelero-phobic', i.e. the sample scanning stages must not to be moved to avoid parasitic additional load. Without beam scanning, only one single position within the sample can be probed during the test. The probed material point may even change because of drifts or movements induced by the test itself. The new scanning approach facilitates the in situ mapping of the entire wire giving access to the evolution of the wire shape as well as to the boundary conditions. This novel scanning technique opens promising perspectives for studies where sample motion is forbidden because of the sample environment.		[Leclere, C.; Cornelius, T.

Two different Pd precursors were investigated in view of optimizing the morphology and the gas sensing performance of the resulting nanostructured films. In particular, palladium acetylacetonate was found to be more suitable than ammonium hexachloropalladate for obtaining n-type WO3 NNs uniformly decorated with well dispersed p-type PdO NPs. The active films could be directly deposited on the electrode area of microelectromechanical system-based resistive transducers. The morphology and chemical composition of the films was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. PdO-decorated WO3 NNs show a response toward hydrogen that is about 680 times higher than that of bare WO3 NNs. Finally, PdO-loaded sensors display extremely low-cross sensitivity to water vapor, which makes them remarkably immune to changes in the background humidity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Stress buildup during crystallization of thin chalcogenide films for memory applications: In situ combination of synchrotron X-Ray diffraction and wafer curvature measurements								THIN SOLID FILMS				617				44	47		10.1016/j.tsf.2016.02.020			OCT 30 2016	2016	Phase change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) undergo a reversible amorphous-to-crystal transition that is the basis of their interest for next generation non-volatile memories. The large density change upon crystallization raises important issues because of the large mechanical stresses occurring during memory cycling. In order to investigate the intimate relationship between stress buildup and microstructure evolution we have built a dedicated setup, which allows combining X-ray diffraction and curvature measurements on DiffAbs beamline at SOLEIL synchrotron. Using a thin (30 nm) GST film deposited on Si we show that this setup yields a wealth of interesting results. A clear correlation is observed between phase transition and stress buildup. Detailed information is obtained on the thermomechanical behavior of the different phases. Systematic investigation of PCMs with this original setup will help understanding the thermomechanical behavior of PCM thin films and nanostructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since tunnelling is a nonperturbative phenomenon, it cannot be described in terms of quantum fluctuations around a classical solution, and a background-free formulation of quantum gravity is needed to analyze it. Here, we use loop quantum gravity to compute the amplitude for this process, in a first approximation. The amplitude determines the tunnelling time as a function of the mass. This is the key information to evaluate the relevance of this process for the interpretation of fast radio bursts or high-energy cosmic rays. The calculation offers a template and a concrete example of how a background-free quantum theory of gravity can be used to compute a realistic observable quantity.

A parametric study is made and finally an appropriate model was chosen to present the comparison between experimental and numerical results. The mesh and the RVE size/fibers size ratio are the most sensitives attributes. Considering the numerical model is in the framework of elasticity and elasto-plasticity, it is in good agreement with the macroscopic response. To improve the accuracy of the model, a further study accounting the interface and damage phenomenons as matrix cracking and fiber/matrix debonding is suggested. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Two series expansions for the logarithm of the gamma function involving Stirling numbers and containing only rational coefficients for certain arguments related to pi(-1)								JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS				442	2			404	434		10.1016/j.jmaa.2016.04.032			OCT 15 2016	2016	In this paper, two new series for the logarithm of the P-function are presented and studied. Their polygamma analogs are also obtained and discussed. These series involve the Stirling numbers of the first kind and have the property to contain only rational coefficients for certain arguments related to pi(-1). In particular, for any value of the form In Gamma(1/2n +/- alpha pi(-1)) and Psi k(1/2n +/- alpha pi(-1)), where Psi(k) stands for the kth polygamma function, a is positive rational greater than 1/6 pi, n is integer and k is non-negative integer, these series have rational terms only. In the specified zones of convergence, derived series converge uniformly at the same rate as Sigma(n In(m)n)(-2), where m = 1, 2, 3, ... , depending on the order of the polygamma function. Explicit expansions into the series with rational coefficients are given for the most attracting values, such as In Gamma(pi(-1)), In Gamma(2 pi(-1)), ln Gamma(1/2 + pi(-1)), Psi(pi(-1)), Psi(1/2 + pi(-1)) and Psi(k)(pi(-1)). Besides, in this article, the reader will also find a number of other series involving Stirling numbers, Gregory's coefficients (logarithmic numbers, also known as Bernoulli numbers of the second kind), Cauchy numbers and generalized Bernoulli numbers. Finally, several estimations and full asymptotics for Gregory's coefficients, for Cauchy numbers, for certain generalized Bernoulli numbers and for certain sums with the Stirling numbers are obtained. In particular, these include sharp bounds for Gregory's coefficients and for the Cauchy numbers of the second kind. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Motivated by the recent LHC data, indicating the presence of an excess in the diphoton spectrum at approximately 750 GeV, we illustrate this threshold enhancement mechanism in the case of a 750 GeV pseudoscalar boson A with a two-photon decay mediated by a charged and uncolored fermion having a mass at the 1/2M(A) threshold and a small decay width, < 1 MeV. The implications of such a threshold enhancement are discussed in two explicit scenarios: i) the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in which the A state is produced via the top quark mediated gluon fusion process and decays into photons predominantly through loops of charginos with masses close to 1/2M(A) and ii) a two Higgs doublet model in which A is again produced by gluon fusion but decays into photons through loops of vector-like charged heavy leptons. In both these scenarios, while the mass of the charged fermion has to be adjusted to be extremely close to half of the A resonance mass, the small total widths are naturally obtained if only suppressed three-body decay channels occur. Finally, the implications of some of these scenarios for dark matter are discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The device consists of a composite nanowire/polymer membrane transferred onto a flexible substrate. The active element for light sensing is a vertical array of core/shell p-n junction nanowires containing InGaN/GaN quantum wells grown by MOVPE. Electron/hole generation and transport in core/shell nanowires are modeled within nonequilibrium Green function formalism showing a good agreement with experimental results. Fully flexible transparent contacts based on a silver nanowire network are used for device fabrication, which allows bending the detector to a few millimeter curvature radius without damage. The detector shows a photoresponse at wavelengths shorter than 430 nm with a peak responsivity of 0.096 A/W at 370 nm under zero bias. The operation speed for a 0.3 x 0.3 cm(2) detector patch was tested between 4 Hz and 2 kHz. The -3 dB cutoff was found to be similar to 35 Hz, which is faster than the operation speed for typical photoconductive detectors and which is compatible with UV monitoring applications.

In the stationary phase the system always reaches an out-of-equilibrium, fluctuating, stationary state, independent of its initial conditions. This state has a large and continuous range of dynamics, from dilute-where dunes do not interact-to dense, where the system exhibits both spatial structuring and collective behavior leading to the selection of a particular size for the dunes. In the percolable phase, the system presents a percolation threshold when the initial density increases. This percolation is unusual, as it happens on a continuous space for moving, interacting, finite lifetime dunes. For extreme parameters, the system exhibits a subcritical instability, where some of the dunes in the field grow without bound. We discuss the nature of the asymptotic states and their relations to well-known models of statistical physics.

The proposed model consists of a finite mixture of piecewise polynomial regression models. Each piecewise polynomial regression model is associated with a cluster, and within each cluster, each piecewise polynomial component is associated with a regime (i.e., a segment). We derive two approaches to learning the model parameters: the first is an estimation approach which maximizes the observed-data likelihood via a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, then yielding a fuzzy partition of the curves into K clusters obtained at convergence by maximizing the posterior cluster probabilities. The second is a classification approach and optimizes a specific classification likelihood criterion through a dedicated classification expectation-maximization (CEM) algorithm. The optimal curve segmentation is performed by using dynamic programming. In the classification approach, both the curve clustering and the optimal segmentation are performed simultaneously as the CEM learning proceeds. We show that the classification approach is a probabilistic version generalizing the deterministic K-means-like algorithm proposed in Hbrail, Hugueney, Lechevallier, and Rossi (2010). The proposed approach is evaluated using simulated curves and real-world curves. Comparisons with alternatives including regression mixture models and the K-means-like algorithm for piecewise regression demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

J	La Riviere, Marie; Garel, Marc; Bally, Marc								Localization of endobacteria in the gastrodermis of a Mediterranean gorgonian coral, Paramuricea clavata, using fluorescence in situ hybridization								MARINE BIOLOGY				163	10					206	10.1007/s00227-016-2975-y			OCT 2016	2016	Gorgonian corals are among the most representative species of hard-bottom sublittoral ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea. The red gorgonian, Paramuricea clavata, harbors a specific, spatially and temporally stable bacterial community that may have an important biological role in the function of the holobiont. However, little is known about the microbial-gorgonian relationship, specifically the nature of the interaction established by the bacteria with their host. Documenting the distribution of microorganisms within coral tissue compartments is critical for providing an overall framework for understanding their functional roles. Here, we used histology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect and localize bacteria in the tissues of P. clavata. Aggregates of tightly packed bacteria were found in the endoderm of the polyps, which is consistent with previous observations of endobacteria in the tissues of scleractinian coral species. This finding suggests the existence of an intimate biological integration between specific members of the microbiota and gorgonian corals that likely results from a complex interplay mediating recognition and maintenance of the bacterial associates. In addition to providing the basis for the development of FISH studies in gorgonians, this work includes the first histological description of the inner structure of P. clavata polyps, illustrating the typical features of general gorgonian anatomy.

Diagnosing cross-shelf transport along an ocean front: An observational case study in the Gulf of Lion								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS				121	10			7218	7243		10.1002/2016JC011908			OCT 2016	2016	Exchanges between coastal regions and the open ocean are often associated with intermittent and localized processes such as eddies, fronts, and filaments. Since these features are difficult to observe, their impact has been predominantly investigated using numerical models and remote sensing. In this study, satellite sea surface temperature maps, Lagrangian surface drifter trajectories, and ship-based surveys of currents and hydrography from the Latex10 campaign are used to quantify cross-shelf exchanges associated with a temperature front in the western Gulf of Lion. Satellite imagery and thermosalinograph sections provide the characterization of the various water masses associated with the front. Lagrangian drifter trajectories are used to identify the main transport structures and to quantify the velocity components associated with near-inertial oscillations. These are removed from the instantaneous ADCP observations with which the cross-shelf exchanges are then computed. The results indicate an average outflow of 0.0740.013 Sv and an inflow of 0.0210.006 Sv. Integrated over the 2 week lifetime of the front, such outflow induced a total export of approximate to 9014 km(3) of water, indicating that three to four of such events are sufficient to completely renew the surface waters of the Gulf of Lion. The total import was approximate to 257 km(3), suggesting larger inflows at depth or in the eastern part of the gulf to maintain its volume balance. These in situ estimates represent a key term of comparison for the further development of numerical model-based and satellite-based studies of cross-shelf exchanges associated with this type of processes.

Impacts of mesoscale activity on the water masses and circulation in the Coral Sea								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS				121	10			7277	7289		10.1002/2016JC011861			OCT 2016	2016	The climatological vision of the circulation within the Coral Sea is today well established with the westward circulation of two main jets, the North Caledonian Jet (NCJ) and the North Vanuatu Jet (NVJ) as a consequence of the separation of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) on the islands of New Caledonia, Vanuatu, and Fiji. Each jet has its own dynamic and transports different water masses across the Coral Sea. The influence of mesoscale activity on mean flow and on water mass exchanges is not yet fully explored in this region of intense activity. Our study relies on the analysis of in situ, satellite, and numerical data. Indeed, we first use in situ data from the Bifurcation cruise and from an Argo float, jointly with satellite-derived velocities, to study the eddy influence on the Coral Sea dynamics. We identify an anticyclonic eddy as participating in the transport of NVJ-like water masses into the theoretical pathway of NCJ waters. This transfer from the NVJ to the NCJ is confirmed over the long term by a Lagrangian analysis. In particular, this numerical analysis shows that anticyclonic eddies can contribute up to 70-90% of the overall eddy transfer between those seemingly independent jets. Finally, transports calculated using S-ADCP measurements (0-500 m) show an eddy-induced sensitivity that can reach up to 15 Sv, i.e., the order of the transport of the jets.

Although education is free in both countries, children's enrolment at school is low especially for girls, many of them stay home performing domestic chores or have an economic activity particularly in rural areas. The bivariate probit model highlights the key role of the household head's education, gender and poverty status in determining children's schooling. Drawing on Pal () who extended the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we confirm that children's activity in Sudan and South Sudan is strongly determined by the fact of being a girl or a boy. The article also provides some policy recommendations to address the issues of low school attendance and high gender inequality.

This method enables to state a unique generic condition for the existence of "canard solutions" for such three and four-dimensional singularly perturbed systems which is based on the stability of folded singularities of the normalized slow dynamics deduced from a well-known property of linear algebra. This unique generic condition is perfectly identical to that provided in previous works. Application of this method to the famous three and four-dimensional memristor canonical Chua's circuits for which the classical piecewise-linear characteristic curve has been replaced by a smooth cubic nonlinear function according to the least squares method enables to show the existence of "canard solutions" in such Memristor Based Chaotic Circuits.

Bacteria as part of bioluminescence emission at the deep ANTARES station (North-Western Mediterranean Sea) during a one-year survey								DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS				116				33	40		10.1016/j.dsr.2016.07.014			OCT 2016	2016	Bioluminescent bacteria have been studied during a one-year survey in 2011 at the deep ANTARES site (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, 2000 m depth). The neutrino underwater telescope ANTARES, located at this station, has been used to record the bioluminescence at the same depth. Together with these data, environmental variables (potential temperature, salinity, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon and oxygen) have been characterized in water samples. The year 2011 was characterized by relatively stable conditions, as revealed by minor variability in the monitored oceanographic variables, by low bioluminescence and low current speed. This suggests weak eukaryote participation and mainly non-stimulated light emission. Hence, no processes of dense water have affected the ANTARES station during this survey. Abundance of bioluminescent bacteria belonging to Photobacterium genus, measured by qPCR of the luxF gene, ranged from 1.4 x 10(2) to 7.2 x 10(2) genes mL(-1). Their effective activity was confirmed through mRNA luxF quantification. Our results reveal that bioluminescent bacteria appeared more active than the total counterpart of bacteria, suggesting an ecological benefit of this feature such as favoring interaction with macro-organisms. Moreover, these results show that part of the bioluminescence, recorded at 2000 m depth over one year, could be due to bioluminescent bacteria in stable hydrological conditions.

MARINE GENOMICS				29				55	59		10.1016/j.margen.2016.06.006			OCT 2016	2016	In coastal marine sediment, oxygen fluctuations induced by bioturbating activities are widespread and exert a great influence, not only on the structure and diversity of the microbenthic communities, but also on their activities. Thus, the activity of benthic organisms can have a significant influence on the degradation of hydrocarbons (HC) and can favor the development of hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms in contaminated marine sediments. Here, we have generated metatranscriptomic data from coastal marine sediments affected by oil addition and/or by the reworking activity of the marine polychaete Hediste diversicolor to gain insights into the active microbial groups involved in the response to oil addition under the oxygen-fluctuating conditions. The preliminary results suggest that the macrofauna promote the diversity of active aerobic hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria in marine sediments, even if its influence cannot be strongly observed at the microbial community expression profiles level.

These growth regulators are natural constituents of various higher plants and fungi. Elucidation of electron ionization mass spectrometry (EIMS) fragmentation pathways of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of the different stereoisomers is essential for their characterization and quantification in natural samples. METHODS: EIMS fragmentation pathways of TMS derivatives of isomeric cucurbic acids and methyl cucurbates were investigated. These pathways were deduced by: (i) low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS), (ii) accurate mass measurement, and (iii) deuterium labelling. RESULTS: CID-MS/MS analyses, accurate mass measurement and deuterium labelling allowed us to elucidate EIMS fragmentations of TMS derivatives of several isomeric cucurbic acids and methyl cucurbates and to propose some specific fragment ions useful in addition to chromatographic retention times to characterize individual stereoisomers. As an application of some of the described fragmentations, isomeric cucurbic acids were characterized and quantified in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode in different natural samples. CONCLUSIONS: The EIMS fragmentations of TMS derivatives of isomeric cucurbic acids appear to be distinct when the ether and ester groups are in the cis or trans positions, allowing for an easy differentiation of individual stereoisomers in natural samples.

Methods RE, vertical and leg stiffness (K-vert and K-leg), as well as foot strike angle were measured from two 5-min treadmill running stages performed at a speed of 2.5 (with 10% grade, uphill running) and 2.77 ms(-1) (level running) before and after an 18.4-km TR exercise (approximately 90% of maximal heart rate) in runners wearing minimalist shoes (MS), MS plus added mass (MSm), or traditional shoes (TS). Maximal voluntary contraction torque of knee extensors and perceived muscle pain were also evaluated before and after TR. Results Maximal voluntary contraction values decreased after TR in all footwear conditions (P < 0.001), indicating the occurrence of neuromuscular fatigue. In the nonfatigued condition, runners exhibited a better RE only during level running in MS and MSm (i.e., combined effects of shoe mass and midsole geometry), in association with significant decreases in foot strike angle (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in RE was observed between shod conditions after TR during either uphill or level running. Decreases in both K-vert/K-leg and foot strike angle were more pronounced during running in MS and MSm (P < 0.05) compared with TS, whatever the period. Calf pain increased after TR when wearing MS and MSm compared with TS (P < 0.05). Conclusions These findings indicated specific alterations in RE and biomechanics over time during the MS and MSm conditions compared with the TS condition. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the relationship between RE and footwear with fatigue in experienced minimally shod runners.

Moreover, we prove that there exists a second-order nonequilibrium quantum phase transition with respect to the strength of the magnetic field as soon as the system is truly out of equilibrium.

Its purpose is to establish a classification of the customers in term of their profiles. Customer profiles are characterized by several attributes such as purchasing behavior. In a selling area, a customer adapts his purchases depending on the stimulus he perceives. This strategy can be precise, can follow a routine, or can be elaborated at the time he enters the selling area, hence the need for marketing managers to be able to determine the indecisiveness class of consumers and their types of purchasing. The first study is based on the analyzing hand movements of customers. A structural behavioral architecture is built. We show that the path in front of the store shelves can be seen as a sequence of states. Hence we use a HMM algorithm to describe each decision-making situation. It leads to satisfying results, as it correctly predicts 75% of the subjects' indecisiveness classes. The second part investigates two of the main purchasing scenarios: the routine and the impulse purchasing. To reach this goal, we extract relevant eye-tracking descriptors. We use a supervised learning algorithm (SVM), to build the model and reach performances of 74% of good identification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we treat these systems, their projective and conformal symmetries as well as their quantisation from the point of view of the Eisenhart lift to a Bargmann space-time in n + 2 dimensions, equipped with its covariantly constant null Killing vector field. Reparametrisation of the time variable corresponds to conformal rescalings of the Bargmann metric. We show how the Arnold map lifts to Bargmann spacetime. We contrast the greater generality of the Caldirola-Kannai approach with that of Arnold and Bateman. At the level of quantum mechanics, we are able to show how the relevant Schrodinger equation emerges naturally using the techniques of quantum field theory in curved space times, since a covariantly constant null Killing vector field gives rise to well defined one particle Hilbert space. Time-dependent Lagrangians arise naturally also in cosmology and give rise to the phenomenon of Hubble friction. We provide an account of this for Friedmann-Lemaltre and Bianchi cosmologies and how it fits in with our previous discussion in the non relativistic limit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the cost of reproduction is well known to negatively affect energy investment in growth and maintenance. Here, we investigated these trade-offs during contrasting periods of high versus low fish size and body condition (before/after 2008) in the Gulf of Lions. Female reproductive allocation and performance in anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) were examined based onmorphometric historical data from the 1970s and from 2003 to 2015. Additionally, potential maternal effects on egg quantity and quality were examined in 2014/2015. After 2008, the gonadosomatic index increased for sardine and remained steady for anchovy, while a strong decline in mean length at first maturity indicated earlier maturation for both species. Regarding maternal effects, for both species egg quantity was positively linked to fish size but not to fish lipid reserves, while the egg quality was positively related to lipid reserves. Atresia prevalence and intensity were rather low regardless of fish condition and size. Finally, estimations of total annual numbers of eggs spawned indicated a sharp decrease for sardine since 2008 but a slight increase for anchovy during the last 5 years. This study revealed a biased allocation towards reproduction in small pelagic fish when confronted with a really low body condition. This highlights that fish can maintain high reproductive investment potentially at the cost of other traits which might explain the present disappearance of old and large individuals in the Gulf of Lions.

Models describing wave propagation in coastal zones are often based on the numerical solution of the Mild Slope equation (Kirby, 1984). In this work, an extension of this equation is derived, taking into account the linear variation of the current with depth, which results in a constant horizontal vorticity, slowly varying horizontally, within the background current field. The present approach is based on the asymptotic expansion of the depth-integrated lagrangian, assuming the linear variation of the background current with depth. With the aid of selected examples the role of this horizontal voracity, associated with the assumed background current velocity profile, is then illustrated and emphasized, demonstrating its effect on the propagation of water waves in coastal Areas.

Such monitoring is required by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in order to ensure the Good Environmental Status (GES) of European coastal and offshore marine ecosystems. Time and cost-effective, automatic, techniques are of high interest in this context. An imaging-based protocol has been applied to a high frequency time series (every second day between April 2003 to April 2004 on average) of zooplankton obtained in a coastal site of the NW Mediterranean Sea, Villefranche Bay. One hundred eighty four mesozooplankton net collected samples were analysed with a Zooscan and an associated semi-automatic classification technique. The constitution of a learning set designed to maximize copepod identification with more than 10,000 objects enabled the automatic sorting of copepods with an accuracy of 91% (true positives) and a contamination of 14% (false positives). Twenty seven samples were then chosen from the total copepod time series for detailed visual sorting of copepods after automatic identification. This method enabled the description of the dynamics of two well-known copepod species, Centropages typicus and Temora stylifera, and 7 other taxonomically broader copepod groups, in terms of size, biovolume and abundance-size distributions (size spectra). Also, total copepod size spectra underwent significant changes during the sampling period. These changes could be partially related to changes in the copepod assemblage taxonomic composition and size distributions. This study shows that the use of high throughput imaging systems is of great interest to extract relevant coarse (i.e. total abundance, size structure) and detailed (i.e. selected species dynamics) descriptors of zooplankton dynamics.

Decoherence and relaxation of a single electron in a one-dimensional conductor								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				94	11					115311	10.1103/PhysRevB.94.115311			SEP 27 2016	2016	We study the decoherence and relaxation of a single elementary electronic excitation propagating in a one-dimensional chiral conductor. Using two-particle interferences in the electronic analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment, we analyze quantitatively the decoherence scenario of a single electron propagating along a quantum Hall edge channel at filling factor 2. The decoherence results from the emergence of collective neutral excitations induced by Coulomb interaction and leading, in one dimension, to the destruction of the elementary quasiparticle. This study establishes the relevance of electron quantum optics setups to provide stringent tests of strong interaction effects in one-dimensional conductors described by the Luttinger liquids paradigm.

Results show the formation of a unique Ni-3(In0.53Ga0.47) As phase with a low concentration in-depth gradient of Ni and the decoration of the grain boundaries by In atoms. These analyses indicate that Ni is the main diffusing specie during the growth of Ni-3(In0.53Ga0.47) As phase.

Three mesocosms (50m(3)) located inside the Noumea lagoon (New Caledonia, southwestern Pacific) were enriched with dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in order to promote N-2 fixation in these low-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (LNLC) waters. Initially, the diazotrophic community was dominated by diatom diazotroph associations (DDAs), mainly by Rhizosolenia/Richelia intracellularis, and by Trichodesmium, which fueled enough DDN to sustain the growth of other diverse diatom species and Synechococcus populations that were well adapted to limiting DIP levels. After DIP fertilization (1 mu M) on day 4, an initial lag time of 10 days was necessary for the mesocosm ecosystems to start building up biomass. However, changes in community structure were already observed during this first period, with a significant drop of both Synechococcus and diatom populations, while Prochlorococcus benefited from DIP addition. At the end of this first period, corresponding to when most added DIP was consumed, the diazotroph community changed drastically and became dominated by Cyanothece-like (UCYN-C) populations, which were accompanied by a monospecific bloom of the diatom Cylindrotheca closterium. During the second period, biomass increased sharply together with primary production and N-2-fixation fluxes near tripled. Diatom populations, as well as Synechococcus and nanophytoeukaryotes, showed a re-increase towards the end of the experiment, showing efficient transfer of DDN to nondiazotrophic phytoplankton.

Lumbar intrathecal fentanyl was used to attenuate the central projection of -opioid receptor-sensitive locomotor muscle afferents during a 5km cycling time trial. The findings suggest that the central projection of group III/IV muscle afferent feedback constrains voluntary neural drive' to working locomotor muscle and limits the exercise-induced intramuscular metabolic perturbation. Therefore, the CNS might regulate the degree of metabolic perturbation within locomotor muscle and thereby limit peripheral fatigue. It appears that the group III/IV muscle afferents are an important neural link in this regulatory mechanism, which probably serves to protect locomotor muscle from the potentially severe functional impairment as a consequence of severe intramuscular metabolic disturbance. AbstractTo investigate the role of metabo- and mechanosensitive group III/IV muscle afferents in limiting the intramuscular metabolic perturbation during whole body endurance exercise, eight subjects performed 5km cycling time trials under control conditions (CTRL) and with lumbar intrathecal fentanyl impairing lower limb muscle afferent feedback (FENT). Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained before and immediately after exercise. Motoneuronal output was estimated through vastus lateralis surface electromyography (EMG). Exercise-induced changes in intramuscular metabolites were determined using liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Quadriceps fatigue was quantified by pre- to post-exercise changes in potentiated quadriceps twitch torque (QT(single)) evoked by electrical femoral nerve stimulation. Although motoneuronal output was 2112% higher during FENT compared to CTRL (P<0.05), time to complete the time trial was similar (approximate to 8.8min). Compared to CTRL, power output during FENT was 104% higher in the first half of the time trial, but 115% lower in the second half (both P<0.01). The exercise-induced increase in intramuscular inorganic phosphate, H+, adenosine diphosphate, lactate and phosphocreatine depletion was 5530, 6218, 129 +/- 63, 47 +/- 14 (P<0.001) and 27 +/- 14% (P<0.01) greater in FENT than CTRL. QT(single) was greater following FENT than CTRL (-52 +/- 2vs -31 +/- 1%, P<0.001) and this difference was positively correlated with the difference in inorganic phosphate (r(2)=0.79; P<0.01) and H+ (r(2)=0.92; P<0.01). In conclusion, during whole body exercise, group III/IV muscle afferents provide feedback to the CNS which, in turn, constrains motoneuronal output to the active skeletal muscle. This regulatory mechanism limits the exercise-induced intramuscular metabolic perturbation, preventing an abnormal homeostatic challenge and excessive peripheral fatigue.

We propose a new discretisation strategy for these equations based on a discrete variational principle applied to a formal Lagrangian. The resulting integrator preserves important quantities like the total energy, magnetic helicity and cross helicity exactly (up to machine precision). As the integrator is free of numerical resistivity, spurious reconnection along current sheets is absent in the ideal case. If effects of electron inertia are added, reconnection of magnetic field lines is allowed, although the resulting model still possesses a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure. After reviewing the conservation laws of the model equations, the adopted variational principle with the related conservation laws isdescribed both at the continuous and discrete level. We verify the favourable properties of the variational integrator in particular with respect to the preservation of the invariants of the models under consideration and compare with results from the literature and those of a pseudo-spectral code.

A 1-D vertical biogeochemical mechanistic model was used in addition to the in situ experiment to enrich our understanding of the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem and the main biogeochemical carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) fluxes. The mesocosms were intentionally enriched with similar to 0.8 mu mol L-1 of inorganic P to trigger the development of diazotrophs and amplify biogeochemical fluxes. Two simulations were run, one with and the other without the phosphate enrichment. In the P-enriched simulation, N-2 fixation, primary production (PP) and C export increased by 201, 208 and 87 %, respectively, consistent with the trends observed in the mesocosms (+124, +141 and +261% for N-2 fixation, PP and C export, respectively). In total, 5-10 days were necessary to obtain an increase in primary and export productions after the dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) enrichment, thereby suggesting that classical methods (short-term microcosms experiments) used to quantify nutrient limitations of primary production may not be relevant. The model enabled us to monitor the fate of fixed N-2 by providing the proportion of DDN in each compartment (inorganic and organic) of the model over time. At the end of the simulation (25 days), 43% of the DDN was found in the non-diazotroph organisms, 33% in diazotrophs, 16% in the dissolved organic nitrogen pool, 3% in the particulate detrital organic pool and 5% in traps, indicating that N-2 fixation was of benefit to non-diazotrophic organisms and contributed to C export.

Constraints on the neutrino emission from the Galactic Ridge with the ANTARES telescope								PHYSICS LETTERS B				760				143	148		10.1016/j.physletb.2016.06.051			SEP 10 2016	2016	A highly significant excess of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos has been reported by the IceCube Collaboration. Some features of the energy and declination distributions of IceCube events hint at a North/South asymmetry of the neutrino flux. This could be due to the presence of the bulk of our Galaxy in the Southern hemisphere. The ANTARES neutrino telescope, located in the Mediterranean Sea, has been taking data since 2007. It offers the best sensitivity to muon neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic ray interactions in this region of the sky. In this letter a search for an extended neutrino flux from the Galactic Ridge region is presented. Different models of neutrino production by cosmic ray propagation are tested. No excess of events is observed and upper limits for different neutrino flux spectral indices Gamma are set. For Gamma = 2.4 the 90% confidence level flux upper limit at 100 TeV for one neutrino flavour corresponds to phi(1f)(0) (100TeV) = 2.0 . 10(-17) GeV-1 cm(-2) s(-1) sr(-1). Under this assumption, at most two events of the IceCube cosmic candidates can originate from the Galactic Ridge. A simple power-law extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT flux to account for IceCube High Energy Starting Events is excluded at 90% confidence level. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Belcher, Anna; Iversen, Morten; Giering, Sarah; Riou, Virginie; Henson, Stephanie A.; Berline, Leo; Guilloux, Loic; Sanders, Richard								Depth-resolved particle-associated microbial respiration in the northeast Atlantic								BIOGEOSCIENCES				13	17			4927	4943		10.5194/bg-13-4927-2016			SEP 7 2016	2016	Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are tightly linked to the depth at which sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) is remineralised in the ocean. Rapid attenuation of downward POC flux typically occurs in the upper mesopelagic (top few hundred metres of the water column), with much slower loss rates deeper in the ocean. Currently, we lack understanding of the processes that drive POC attenuation, resulting in large uncertainties in the mesopelagic carbon budget. Attempts to balance the POC supply to the mesopelagic with respiration by zooplankton and microbes rarely succeed. Where a balance has been found, depth-resolved estimates reveal large compensating imbalances in the upper and lower mesopelagic. In particular, it has been suggested that respiration by free-living microbes and zooplankton in the upper mesopelagic are too low to explain the observed flux attenuation of POC within this layer. We test the hypothesis that particle-associated microbes contribute significantly to community respiration in the mesopelagic, measuring particle-associated microbial respiration of POC in the northeast Atlantic through shipboard measurements on individual marine snow aggregates collected at depth (36-500 m). We find very low rates of both absolute and carbon-specific particle-associated microbial respiration (<3% d(-1)), suggesting that this term cannot solve imbalances in the upper mesopelagic POC budget. The relative importance of particle-associated microbial respiration increases with depth, accounting for up to 33% of POC loss in the mid-mesopelagic (128-500 m). We suggest that POC attenuation in the upper mesopelagic (36-128 m) is driven by the transformation of large, fast-sinking particles to smaller, slow-sinking and suspended particles via processes such as zooplankton fragmentation and solubilisation, and that this shift to non-sinking POC may help to explain imbalances in the mesopelagic carbon budget.

Budget of organic carbon in the North-Western Mediterranean open sea over the period 2004-2008 using 3-D coupled physical-biogeochemical modeling								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS				121	9			7026	7055		10.1002/2016JC011818			SEP 2016	2016	A 3-D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical coupled model has been used to estimate a budget of organic carbon and its interannual variability over the 5 year period 2004-2008 in the North-Western Mediterranean Open Sea (NWMOS). The comparison of its results with in situ and satellite observations reveals that the timing and the magnitude of the convection and bloom processes during the study period, marked by contrasted atmospheric conditions, are reasonably well reproduced by the model. Model outputs show that the amount of nutrients annually injected into the surface layer is clearly linked to the intensity of the events of winter convection. During cold winters, primary production is reduced by intense mixing events but then spectacularly increases when the water column restratifies. In contrast, during mild winters, the primary production progressively and continuously increases, sustained by moderate new production followed by regenerated production. Overall, interannual variability in the annual primary production is low. The export in subsurface and at middepth is however affected by the intensity of the convection process, with annual values twice as high during cold winters than during mild winters. Finally, the estimation of a global budget of organic carbon reveals that the NWMOS acts as a sink for the shallower areas and as a source for the Algerian and Balearic subbasins.

Hamiltonian reduced fluid model for plasmas with temperature and heat flux anisotropies								THEORETICAL AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS				188	3			1377	1393		10.1134/S0040577916090099			SEP 2016	2016	For an arbitrary number of species, we derive a Hamiltonian fluid model for strongly magnetized plasmas describing the evolution of the density, velocity, and electromagnetic fluctuations and also of the temperature and heat flux fluctuations associated with motions parallel and perpendicular to the direction of a background magnetic field. We derive the model as a reduction of the infinite hierarchy of equations obtained by taking moments of a Hamiltonian drift-kinetic system with respect to Hermite-Laguerre polynomials in velocity-magnetic-moment coordinates. We show that a closure relation directly coupling the heat flux fluctuations in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the background magnetic field provides a fluid reduction that preserves the Hamiltonian character of the parent drift-kinetic model. We find an alternative set of dynamical variables in terms of which the Poisson bracket of the fluid model takes a structure of a simple direct sum and permits an easy identification of the Casimir invariants. Such invariants in the limit of translational symmetry with respect to the direction of the background magnetic field turn out to be associated with Lagrangian invariants of the fluid model. We show that the coupling between the parallel and perpendicular heat flux evolutions introduced by the closure is necessary for ensuring the existence of a Hamiltonian structure with a Poisson bracket obtained as an extension of a Lie-Poisson bracket.

J	Rey, Olivier; Maiano, Christophe; Nicol, Caroline; Mercier, Charles-Symphorien; Vallier, Jean-Marc								Psycho-Physiological Responses of Obese Adolescents to an Intermittent Run Test Compared with a 20-M Shuttle Run								JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE AND MEDICINE				15	3			451	459					SEP 2016	2016	Among the running field tests that measure aerobic fitness indirectly, the 20-m shuttle run test is the one most commonly used among obese youth. However, this back and forth running test induces premature cessation of exercise in this population. The present study aimed to examine the psycho-physiological responses of obese adolescents to an intermittent (15-15) progressive and maximal run test as compared with a continuous shuttle run test. Eleven obese adolescents (age: 14-15 years; BMI = 34.01 +/- 5.30 kg.m(-2)) performed both tests. A two-way ANOVA examined the main effects of the running test, participant's sex, and their interaction on maximal aerobic performance (net exercise duration and final velocity), physiological values (heart rate, pulmonary oxygen uptake, respiratory exchange ratio and blood lactate concentration) and psychological responses (rating of perceived exertion, and physical self-perceptions). Oxygen uptake and heart-rate values at 9 km.h(-1) were also compared. Compared with a 20-m shuttle run, the 15-15 test induced lower pulmonary oxygen uptake values at 9 km/h (28.3 +/- 2.7 vs. 35.4 +/- 2.7 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) and finished with higher maximal velocity and net exercise duration (566 +/- 156 vs. 346 +/- 156 s, p < 0.001), with no inter-test physiological difference. The 15-15 test also resulted in higher ratings of perceived exertion (16.0 +/- 1.2 vs. 12.7 +/- 1.6, p < 0.001) and improved perceived physical condition compared with the 20-m shuttle run (+1.4 +/- 1.4 vs. +0.2 +/- 1.0, p < 0.05). Both tests induced a maximal aerobic power of obese adolescents, but the 15-15 test provided a more progressive speed increment and longer exercise duration. The 15-15 test also elicited a significant improvement of perceived physical condition. In conclusion the 15-15 test can be considered a relevant field test for assessing the aerobic fitness of obese adolescents.

This transient initial state is characterized by a poorly ordered atomic structure, which may be inaccessible by X-ray diffraction techniques. In this work, we apply X-ray absorption spectroscopy in situ to address the local structure of Zn after each atomic layer deposition cycle, using a custom-built reactor mounted at a synchrotron beamline, and we shed light on the atomistic mechanisms taking place during the first stages of the growth. We find that such mechanisms are surprisingly different for zinc oxide growth on amorphous (silica) and crystalline (sapphire) substrate. Ab initio simulations and quantitative data analysis allow the formulation of a comprehensive growth model, based on the different effects of surface atoms and grain boundaries in the nanoscale islands, and the consequent induced local disorder. From a comparison of these specttoscopy results with those from X-ray diffraction reported recently, we observe that the final structure of the zinc oxide nanolayers depends strongly on the mechanisms taking place during the initial stages of growth. The approach followed here for the case of zinc oxide will be of general interest for characterizing and optimizing the growth and properties of more complex nanostructures.

Consequently, telomeres shorten with age in many endotherms, and this shortening is accelerated under stressful environmental conditions. Data in ectotherm vertebrates remain scarce so far, so our goal was to review existing data for fish and to test the influence of age and stress on telomere length in a very long-lived fish, the Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii). Our review of the literature revealed age-related telomere shortening in approximately half of the published studies. In the Siberian sturgeon, we found a significant telomere shortening with age, both at the intraindividual level using red blood cells (-12.5% in 16 mo) and at the interindividual level using cross-sectional samples of fin over an age range of 8 yr. We also found that heat stress (30 degrees C) significantly reduced telomere length by 15.0% after only 1 mo of exposure. Our results highlight that both age and stressful environmental conditions might be important determinants of telomere length in fish.

This motivated the proposal of a new track at CLEF INEX lab of Tweet Contextualization. The objective of this task was to help a user to understand a tweet by providing him with a short explanatory summary (500 words). This summary should be built automatically using resources like Wikipedia and generated by extracting relevant passages and aggregating them into a coherent summary. Running for four years, results show that the best systems combine NLP techniques with more traditional methods. More precisely the best performing systems combine passage retrieval, sentence segmentation and scoring, named entity recognition, text part-of-speech (POS) analysis, anaphora detection, diversity content measure as well as sentence reordering. This paper provides a full summary report on the four-year long task. While yearly overviews focused on system results, in this paper we provide a detailed report on the approaches proposed by the participants and which can be considered as the state of the art for this task. As an important result from the 4 years competition, we also describe the open access resources that have been built and collected.

Our main contribution is to introduce new efficient mapping mechanisms that improve some typical mappings for LBP-based operators in texture classification such as rotation invariant patterns (ri), rotation invariant uniform patterns (riu 2), and Local Binary Count (LBC). Like them, the proposed approach allows contrast and rotation invariant image description using more compact descriptors by projecting binary patterns to a reduced feature space. However, its expressiveness, and then its discrimination capability, is higher, since it includes additional information, related to the connected components of the binary patterns. The proposed mapping, evaluated and compared with different popular mappings, validates the interest of our approach. We then develop Complemented Patterns of Topological Attributes (CTAP) that generalize TAP model and exploit complemented information to further enhance its discrimination capability, and evaluate it on different texture datasets.

We propose a distributed method to extend the network lifetime by managing how tasks are assigned to different nodes. A detailed model of energy consumption of the wireless sensor nodes is provided and a gossip-based algorithm that only exploits iterative and asynchronous optimizations involving local information between neighboring nodes to maximize the global network lifetime is proposed. Experimental results and simulations performed on the embedded hardware show that our framework can provide a significant lifetime extension, particularly for networks with high node densities and nonuniform energy consumption or initial battery charge.

These observation structures, however, are rather limited, namely they do not cover all cases of practical interest where complex observations are possible. We consider in this paper more general ones, by correspondingly defining two new classes of Petri net generators: labeled Petri nets with outputs (LPNOs) and adaptive labeled Petri nets (ALPNs). To compare the modeling power of different Petri net generators, the notion of observation equivalence is proposed. ALPNs are shown to be the class of bounded generators possessing the highest modeling power. Looking for bridges between the different formalisms, we first present a general procedure to convert a bounded LPNO into an equivalent ALPN or even into an equivalent labeled Petri net (if any exists). Finally, we discuss the possibility of converting an unbounded LPNO into an equivalent ALPN.

The space of theories is spanned by a certain number of parameters determining the linear cosmological perturbations, while the expansion history is set to that of a standard Lambda CDM model. We always demand that the theories be free of fatal instabilities. Additionally, we consider two optional conditions, namely that scalar and tensor perturbations propagate with subliminal speed. Such criteria severely restrict the allowed parameter space and are thus very effective in shaping the posteriors. As a result, we confirm that no theory performs better than Lambda CDM when CMB data alone are analysed. Indeed, the healthy dark energy models considered here are not able to reproduce those phenomenological behaviours of the effective Newton constant and gravitational slip parameters that, according to previous studies, best fit the data		[Salvatelli, Valentina; Piazza, Federico; Marinoni, Christian] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS 8232, CPT,UMR 7332, 163 Ave Luminy, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Salvatelli, Valentina] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS 8232, CPT,UMR 7332, 163 Ave Luminy, F-13288 Marseille, France								31							Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics, Particles & Fields	WOS:000389772300042

DMS concentration has been seen to vary across seasons and latitudes with plankton taxonomy and activity, and following the seascape of ocean's physics. However, whether and how does it vary at the time scales of meteorology and day-night cycles is largely unknown. Here we used high-resolution measurements over time and depth within coherent water patches in the open sea to show that DMS concentration responded rapidly but resiliently to mesoscale meteorological perturbation. Further, it varied over diel cycles in conjunction with rhythmic photobiological indicators in phytoplankton. Combining data and modelling, we show that sunlight switches and tunes the balance between net biological production and abiotic losses. This is an outstanding example of how biological diel rhythms affect biogeochemical processes.		[Royer, S. -J.; Gali, M.; Ross, O.

The sphere represents the horizon. The punctures are the edges of spin-networks in the bulk which cross the horizon and carry quanta of area. One can generalize this construction and model a rotating black hole by adding an extra puncture colored with the angular momentum J in the 2-sphere. We compute the entropy of rotating black holes in this model and study its semi-classical limit. After performing an analytic continuation which sends the Barbero-Immirzi parameter to gamma = +/- i, we show that the leading order term in the semi-classical expansion of the entropy reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking law independently of the value of J.

We focus on the aging effects emerging from the non-Poissonian dynamics of link activation, and on their effects on the topological properties of time-integrated networks, such as the degree distribution. Analytic expressions for the degree distribution of integrated networks as a function of time are derived, exploring both limits of vanishing and strong aging. We also address the percolation process occurring on these temporal networks, by computing the threshold for the emergence of a giant connected component, highlighting the aging dependence. Our analytic predictions are checked by means of extensive numerical simulations of the NoPAD model.

Despite their ecological importance, the response of microbial communities to chronic PAH pollution, one of the major threats to coastal ecosystems, has received very little attention. In one of the largest surveys performed so far on coastal sediments, the diversity and composition of microbial communities inhabiting both chronically contaminated and non-contaminated coastal sediments were investigated using high throughput sequencing on the 18S and 16S rRNA genes. Prokaryotic alpha-diversity showed significant association with salinity, temperature, and organic carbon content. The effect of particle size distribution was strong on eukaryotic diversity. Similarly to alpha-diversity, beta diversity patterns were strongly influenced by the environmental filter, while PAHs had no influence on the prokaryotic community structure and a weak impact on the eukaryotic community structure at the continental scale. However, at the regional scale, PAHs became the main driver shaping the structure of bacterial and eukaryotic communities. These patterns were not found for PICRUSt predicted prokaryotic functions, thus indicating some degree of functional redundancy. Eukaryotes presented a greater potential for their use as PAH contamination biomarkers, owing to their stronger response at both regional and continental scales.

Three asymptotic light-cone distribution amplitudes of twist-4 (and 5) are determined, necessary for the form factors to obey the equations of motion. It is argued that the latter constrain the uncertainty of tensor-to-vector form factor ratios thereby improving the prediction of zeros of helicity amplitudes of major importance for B -> K* ll angular observables. We provide easy-to-use fits to the LCSR results, including the full error correlation matrix, in all modes at low q(2) as well as combined fits to LCSR and lattice results covering the entire kinematic range for Bq K*, B, K* and B, phi. The error correlation matrix avoids the problem of overestimating the uncertainty in phenomenological applications. Using the new form factors and recent computations of non-factorisable contributions we provide Standard Model predictions for B -> K*gamma as well as B -> K*l(+)l(-) f and B, -> phi mu(+)mu(-) at low dilepton invariant mass. Employing our B (p,w) form factor results we extract the CKM element vertical bar V-ub vertical bar from the semileptonic decays B (p,w)lv and find good agreement with other exclusive determinations.

J	Rogers, Mark W.; Mille, Marie-Laure								Timing paradox of stepping and falls in ageing: not so quick and quick(er) on the trigger								JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON				594	16			4537	4547		10.1113/JP271167			AUG 15 2016	2016	Physiological and degenerative changes affecting human standing balance are major contributors to falls with ageing. During imbalance, stepping is a powerful protective action for preserving balance that may be voluntarily initiated in recognition of a balance threat, or be induced by an externally imposed mechanical or sensory perturbation. Paradoxically, with ageing and falls, initiation slowing of voluntary stepping is observed together with perturbation-induced steps that are triggered as fast as or faster than for younger adults. While age-associated changes in sensorimotor conduction, central neuronal processing and cognitive functions are linked to delayed voluntary stepping, alterations in the coupling of posture and locomotion may also prolong step triggering. It is less clear, however, how these factors may explain the accelerated triggering of induced stepping. We present a conceptual model that addresses this issue. For voluntary stepping, a disruption in the normal coupling between posture and locomotion may underlie step-triggering delays through suppression of the locomotion network based on an estimation of the evolving mechanical state conditions for stability. During induced stepping, accelerated step initiation may represent an event-triggering process whereby stepping is released according to the occurrence of a perturbation rather than to the specific sensorimotor information reflecting the evolving instability. In this case, errors in the parametric control of induced stepping and its effectiveness in stabilizing balance would be likely to occur. We further suggest that there is a residual adaptive capacity with ageing that could be exploited to improve paradoxical triggering and other changes in protective stepping to impact fall risk.

The bioconstructions built in the mid-littoral zone by the calcified rhodobiont Lithophyllum byssoides were in poor condition and sometimes even dead. In contrast, the brown alga Cystoseira amentacea constituted lush stands. For assessing the ecological status of the studied area, the CARLIT method, based upon macroalgal communities, was applied. The observed range of ecological status was wide ('high' through 'bad') and was overall among the lowest assessed to date in the Mediterranean Sea. The occurrence of extensive sea-urchin barren grounds, though not taken into consideration by the CARLIT index, confirmed the poor condition of large sectors of the study area. Overall, the CARLIT index is well correlated with anthropogenic pressures, as assessed by the LUSI index. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A new calibration method is proposed to determine the tip geometry from force measurements on reference materials. The test is then modelled by finite element method in order to validate the probe geometry and to determine the (MAZ) on these materials. The numerical simulation is used to show the influence of test parameters and sample elastic modulus on the impacted volume. The evolution of MAZ diameter and depth with Young's modulus and sample displacement can be correctly described by two analytical models. It is then possible to predict the lateral resolution or depth penetration associated to an AFM force measurement on a given polymer. The aim is to optimize test parameters to characterize mechanical interphases at nanometre scale in multiphase materials and to measure polymer surfaces modulus in thin layer systems.

Using the same data we determine here the corrections to Dashen's theorem and the individual up and down quark masses. Our ensembles include 5 lattice spacings down to 0.054 fm, lattice sizes up to 6 fm, and average up-down quark masses all the way down to their physical value. For the parameter which quantifies violations to Dashen's theorem, we obtain epsilon = 0.73(2)(5)(17), where the first error is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is an estimate of the QED quenching error.

Yet the fate and magnitude of the newly fixed N, or diazotroph-derived N (hereafter named DDN) in marine ecosystems is poorly understood. Moreover, whether the DDN is preferentially and directly exported out of the photic zone, recycled by the microbial loop and/or transferred into larger organisms remains unclear. These questions were investigated in the framework of the VAHINE (VAriability of vertical and tropHIc transfer of diazotroph derived N in the south wEst Pacific) project. Triplicate large volume ( similar to aEuro parts per thousand aEuro-50aEuro-m(3)) mesocosms were deployed in the tropical south-west Pacific coastal ocean (New Caledonia). The mesocosms were intentionally fertilized with similar to aEuro parts per thousand aEuro-0.8aEuro-A mu M dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) at the start of the experiment to stimulate diazotrophy. A total of 47 stocks, fluxes, enzymatic activities and diversity parameters were measured daily inside and outside the mesocosms by the 40 scientists involved in the project. The experiment lasted for 23 days and was characterized by two distinct and successive diazotroph blooms: a dominance of diatom-diazotroph associations (DDAs) during the first half of the experiment (days 2-14) followed by a bloom of unicellular cyanobacterial lineage C (UCYN-C during the second half of the experiment (days 15-23). These conditions provided a unique opportunity to compare the DDN transfer and export efficiency associated with different diazotrophs. Here we summarize the major experimental and modelling results obtained during the project and described in the VAHINE special issue, in particular those regarding the evolution of the main standing stocks, fluxes and biological characteristics over the 23-day experiment, the contribution of N-2 fixation to export fluxes, the DDN released to dissolved pool and its transfer to the planktonic food web (bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton). We then apply our Eco3M modelling platform to further infer the fate of DDN in the ecosystem and the role of N-2 fixation on productivity, food web structure and carbon export. Recommendations for future work are finally provided in the conclusion section.

Limits on dark matter annihilation in the sun using the ANTARES neutrino telescope								PHYSICS LETTERS B				759				69	74		10.1016/j.physletb.2016.05.019			AUG 10 2016	2016	A search for muon neutrinos originating from dark matter annihilations in the Sun is performed using the data recorded by the ANTARES neutrino telescope from 2007 to 2012. In order to obtain the best possible sensitivities to dark matter signals, an optimisation of the event selection criteria is performed taking into account the background of atmospheric muons, atmospheric neutrinos and the energy spectra of the expected neutrino signals. No significant excess over the background is observed and 90% C.L. upper limits on the neutrino flux, the spin-dependent and spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-sections are derived for WIMP masses ranging from 50 GeV to 5 TeV for the annihilation channels WIMP + WIMP -> b (b) over bar, W+W- and tau(+)tau(-).

J	Vestergaard, Christian L.								Optimizing experimental parameters for tracking of diffusing particles								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				94	2					022401	10.1103/PhysRevE.94.022401			AUG 2 2016	2016	We describe how a single-particle tracking experiment should be designed in order for its recorded trajectories to contain the most information about a tracked particle's diffusion coefficient. The precision of estimators for the diffusion coefficient is affected by motion blur, limited photon statistics, and the length of recorded time series. We demonstrate for a particle undergoing free diffusion that precision is negligibly affected by motion blur in typical experiments, while optimizing photon counts and the number of recorded frames is the key to precision. Building on these results, we describe for a wide range of experimental scenarios how to choose experimental parameters in order to optimize the precision. Generally, one should choose quantity over quality: experiments should be designed to maximize the number of frames recorded in a time series, even if this means lower information content in individual frames.

We focus on the observability analysis when the target is in constant-velocity (CV) motion. More precisely, the observability conditions are established when the observer's trajectory is composed of one or several legs. We establish a link between the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the observability, after having proven the similarity of this matrix with the FIM encountered in bearings-only target motion analysis (BOTMA). We compare observability statuses in BOTMA and ROTMA in the paper.

Characterization of air-sea exchanges over the Western Mediterranean Sea during HyMeX SOP1 using the AROME-WMED model								QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY				142				173	187		10.1002/qj.2480			AUG 2016	2016	Air-sea exchanges play an important role during intense weather events over the Mediterranean Sea, especially in supplying heat and moisture for heavy precipitation events, which often affect the area. Observations collected during the first Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) Special Observation Period (SOP1) over the Western Mediterranean area in autumn 2012 provide an unprecedented dataset for assessing the capabilities of numerical weather prediction systems to represent the air-sea interface and marine boundary layer during the heavy precipitation season. A HyMeX-dedicated version of Application de la Recherche a l'Operationnel a Meso-Echelle, in French (AROME) covering the whole western Mediterranean basin, named AROME-WMED, was evaluated through comparisons against moored buoys, drifting buoys and ship measurements deployed during the HyMeX campaign. A general, good agreement is found for near-surface meteorological parameters, whereas significant discrepancies are observed during strong air-sea exchange periods. The two main reasons are that (1) sea-surface temperature (SST) is kept constant during the model runs and (2) sensible heat flux is overestimated in strong wind regimes by the AROME turbulent flux parametrization. Air-sea exchanges during SOP1 were characterized thanks to AROME-WMED short-range (1-24h) forecasts. This shows some areas of strong air-sea fluxes in the Gulf of Lion and the Balearic, Ligurian and Tyrrhenian Seas. The Gulf of Lion is the area showing the highest variability of air-sea fluxes, due to dominant strong regional winds (Mistral/Tramontane). Whereas some heavy precipitation events occur without significant air-sea fluxes, all strong air-sea exchange events include, or occur only 1 or 2 days before, heavy precipitation events. A detailed analysis of an Intense Observation Period (IOP) dedicated to a heavy precipitation event (IOP13, from 12-15 October) illustrates how both dynamic (wind) and thermodynamic (temperature and humidity gradient effect) contributions influence air-sea flux evolution.

This systematic review focuses specifically on the relationship between the parameters of anticipatory muscular activities and movement finality in sitting position among adults, to study the adaptability and predictability of anticipatory muscular activities parameters to different movements and conditions in sitting position in adults. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Springer-Link, Engineering Village, and EbscoHost. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to retain the most rigorous and specific studies, yielding 76 articles, Seventeen articles were excluded at first reading, and after the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 were retained. In a sitting position, central nervous system activity precedes movement by diverse anticipatory muscular activities and shows the ability to adapt anticipatory muscular activity parameters to the movement direction, postural stability, or charge weight. In addition, these parameters could be adapted to the speed of execution, as found for the standing position. Parameters of anticipatory muscular activities (duration, order, and amplitude of muscle contractions constituting the anticipatory muscular activity) could be used as a predictive indicator of forthcoming movement. In addition, this systematic review may improve methodology in empirical studies and assistive technology for people with disabilities.

Specifically we explored inter-specific resource partitioning and ontogenetic variability using neutral fatty acids and stable isotope analysis of liver and muscle from small (<100 cm fork length, FL) and large (>100 cm FL) tuna collected in mixed schools at the surface by purse-seine. Both biochemical tracers were used to calculate trophic niche indices that collectively revealed high potential for resource overlap, especially among small tuna. Resource overlap appeared strongest between BET and YFT, with SKJ tissues having high carbon isotope (delta C-13) values (-17 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand), lower nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) values (11.4 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand), and higher relative proportion of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than the two other species, indicating a different diet. Size was found to be a strong predictor for most biochemical tracers in the three species with delta C-13, delta N-15 and total lipid content in the liver. In the larger species (YFT and BET), proportions of mono-unsaturated fatty acids typically increased with size, while quantities of PUFA decreased. In addition to ontogenetic variability, trophic markers were shown to vary between sampling area and season: higher lipid reserves and delta N-15 values, and lower delta C-13 values occurred during monsoon periods around Seychelles than in the Mozambique Channel (parted from about 1500 km). Our multi-tracer approach reveals the magnitude of potential competitive interactions in mixed tropical tuna schools at both small and large sizes and demonstrates that ontogenetic niche differentiation acts as a major factor of coexistence in tropical tuna.

Nuclear heating can be quantified with a differential calorimeter by using in-pile temperature measurements and the preliminary out-of-pile calibration curves of each calorimetric cell. This paper focuses on experimental studies of two new calorimetric cell prototypes developed to test the influence of the Joule effect heating of specific cell body areas on the out-of-pile-calibration curves. The calibration curves are determined, discussed for different applied internal/external thermal conditions, and compared to irradiation data obtained with the CARMEN-1P type calorimeter used in the OSIRIS reflector.

Here we report a bimonthly survey conducted in 2010-11 in three lagoons (Bages-Sigean, Thau and Berre) and at two adjacent coastal stations (Sete and SOMLIT-Marseille) along the French Mediterranean coast. M. leidyi was present only in Berre and Bages-Sigean with maximum abundances observed in late summer. M. leidyi adults were present year round in Berre with the largest organisms (similar to 6 cm) observed in April. In Bages-Sigean, they occurred in sufficient abundance to be recorded by fishermen between August and November.

This concept is developed for renewable energy production system (Reps) like wind turbines or photovoltaic panel. REPS generate clean and inexhaustible energy. However the production of this energy is unpredictable because it depends on the weather. Moreover failures that occur on the means of production make the operation less interesting. However the implementation of technical resources (fault detection sensor, vehicles and transfer system for technicians, tools and spare parts) improves the performance of the production system. In this paper a model for REPS with an application on wind energy production system (offshore wind farm + maintenance systems) was developed and simulations have been performed. Hence we show the importance to design and optimize the maintenance the REPS for reducing cost and environmental issues.

The goal of this study is to demonstrate that these Usage EcoDrifts must be taken into account during the design stage to better the environmental performance of the use phase of the product. In this paper, we study the case of different usages of a vacuum cleaner and their environmental consequences. We first conducted a survey to gather information on how people use the product. Then, we conducted experimentations to measure the consequences of the usages. We also explored how the testers responded to feedback inviting them to adopt a more sustainable behaviour. Results show that most of the users do not use the product optimally and cause additional environmental impact. Several usage ecodrifts were identified, causing both abnormal energy overconsumption and wear and tear of the product. The calculations show that delayed environmental impacts, because their consequence is the early replacement of the whole product, are of much greater importance than real-time environmental impacts.

Monitoring abiotic degradation in sinking versus suspended Arctic sea ice algae during a spring ice melt using specific lipid oxidation tracers								ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY				98				82	97		10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.05.016			AUG 2016	2016	The abiotic degradation state of sea ice algae released during a late spring ice melt process was determined by sampling the underlying waters and measuring certain well-known algal lipids and their oxidation products, including those derived from epi-brassicasterol, 24-methylenecholesterol, palmitoleic acid and the phytyl side-chain of chlorophyll. More specifically, parent lipids and some of their oxidation products were quantified in suspended (collected by filtration) and sinking (collected with sediment traps at 5 and 30 m) particles from Resolute Passage (Canada) during a period of spring ice melt in 2012 and the outcomes compared with those obtained from related sea ice samples analyzed previously. Our data show that suspended cells in the near surface waters appeared to be only very weakly affected by photooxidative processes, likely indicative of a community of unaggregated living cells with high seeding potential for further growth. In contrast, we attribute the strong photooxidation state of the organic matter in the sediment traps deployed at 5 m to the presence of senescent and somewhat aggregated sea ice algae that descended only relatively slowly within the euphotic zone, and was thus susceptible to photochemical degradation. On the other hand, the increased abiotic preservation of the sinking material collected in the sediment traps deployed at 30 m, likely reflected more highly aggregated senescent sea ice algae that settled sufficiently rapidly out of the euphotic zone to avoid significant photooxidation. This better-preserved sinking material in the deeper sediment traps may therefore contribute more strongly to the underlying sediments. A three-component conceptual scheme summarizing the abiotic behavior of Arctic sea ice algae in underlying waters is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wearable devices commonly used in clinical practice for sweat sampling (i.e., Macroducts) were positioned on the body of an athlete whose sweat rate was then monitored during cycling sessions. The position at which the sweat fills the Macroduct was indicated by a contrasting marker and captured via a series of time-stamped photos or a video recording of the device during an exercise period. Given that the time of each captured image/frame is known (either through time stamp on photos or the constant frame rate of the video capture), it was, therefore, possible to estimate the sweat flow rate through a simple calibration model. The importance of gathering such valuable information is described, together with the results from a number of exercise trials to investigate the viability of this approach.

First, we study the interplay between Andreev and specular scattering at the interface on the distribution of waiting times of electrons or holes separately. In that case the distribution is not altered dramatically compared to the case of a single quantum channel with a quantum point contact since the interface acts as an Andreev mirror for holes. We then consider a fully entangled state originating from splitting of Cooper pairs at the interface and demonstrate a significant enhancement of the probability to detect two consecutive electrons in a short time interval. Finally, we discuss the electronic waiting time distribution in the more realistic situation of partial entanglement. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

With an in situ two-step process (annealing and Ge deposition) we produce two families of islands on the same sample: Si-rich, formed during the first step and, all around them, Ge-rich formed after Ge deposition. By increasing the amount of Ge deposited on the annealed samples from 0 to 18 monolayers, the islands' shape in the Si-rich zones can be tuned from elongated and flat to more symmetric and with a larger vertical aspect ratio. At the same time, the spatial extension of the Ge-rich zones is progressively increased as well as the Ge content in the islands. Further processing by ex situ rapid thermal oxidation results in the formation of a core-shell composition profile in both Si and Ge-rich zones with atomically sharp heterointerfaces. The Ge condensation induces a Ge enrichment of the islands' shell of up to 50% while keeping a pure Si core in the Si-rich zones and a similar to 25% SiGe alloy in the Ge-rich ones. The large lattice mismatch between core and shell, the absence of dislocations and the islands' monocrystalline nature render this novel class of nanostructures a promising device platform for strain-based band-gap engineering. Finally, this method can be used for the implementation of ultralarge scale meta-surfaces with dielectric Mie resonators for light manipulation at the nanoscale.

In parallel, sprat biomass, which was negligible before, has increased tenfold. All of these changes have strongly affected the regional fisheries. Using trophic and isotopic data from contrasting periods of low versus high growth and condition, we investigated potential changes in diet and interspecific feeding interactions through time. Evidence of resource partitioning was found between sprat and both anchovy and sardine in 2004 and 2005. Since 2010, the isotopic niches of the 3 species have tended to overlap, suggesting higher risk of competition for food resources. Moreover, the wider trophic niche of sprat indicates higher variability in individual diets. Anchovy and sardine diet varied through time, with a high proportion of large copepods or cladocerans in periods of high growth and condition (1994 and 2007, respectively) versus a dominance of small copepods in the present (2011-2012). Furthermore, an important reduction in prey diversity was also identified in the diet of both anchovy and sardine during the most recent period. Our results support the hypothesis that changes in small pelagic fish growth, size and body condition and ultimately biomass could be due to bottom-up control characterized by changes in food availability and increasing potential trophic competition.

However, several methodological issues are still unresolved, such as which method of contact measurement is the most valid. Further, complete network analysis requires data from most, ideally all, members of a network and, to achieve this, acceptance of the measurement method. We aimed at investigating measurement error by comparing two methods of contact measurement - paper diaries vs. wearable proximity sensors - that were applied concurrently to the same population, and we measured acceptability. Methods: We investigated the contact network of one day of an epidemiology conference in September 2014. Seventy-six participants wore proximity sensors throughout the day while concurrently recording their contacts with other study participants in a paper-diary; they also reported on method acceptability. Results: There were 329 contact reports in the paper diaries, corresponding to 199 contacts, of which 130 were noted by both parties. The sensors recorded 316 contacts, which would have resulted in 632 contact reports if there had been perfect concordance in recording. We estimated the probabilities that a contact was reported in a diary as: P = 72 % for <5 min contact duration (significantly lower than the following, p < 0.05), P = 86 % for 5-15 min, P = 89 % for 15-60 min, and P = 94 % for >60 min. The sets of sensor-measured and self-reported contacts had a large intersection, but neither was a subset of the other. Participants' aggregated contact duration was mostly substantially longer in the diary data than in the sensor data. Twenty percent of respondents (>1 reported contact) stated that filling in the diary was too much work, 25 % of respondents reported difficulties in remembering contacts, and 93 % were comfortable having their conference contacts measured by sensors. Conclusion: Reporting and recording were not complete; reporting was particularly incomplete for contacts < 5 min. The types of contact that both methods are capable of detecting are partly different. Participants appear to have overestimated the duration of their contacts. Conducting a study with diaries or wearable sensors was acceptable to and mostly easily done by participants. Both methods can be applied meaningfully if their specific limitations are considered and incompleteness is accounted for.

KINEMATIC FEATURES OF WHOLE-BODY REACHING MOVEMENTS UNDERWATER: NEUTRAL BUOYANCY EFFECTS								NEUROSCIENCE				327				125	135		10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.04.014			JUL 7 2016	2016	Astronauts' training is conventionally performed in a pool to reproduce weightlessness by exploiting buoyancy which is supposed to reduce the impact of gravity on the body. However, this training method has not been scientifically validated yet, and requires first to study the effects of underwater exposure on motor behavior. We examined the influence of neutral buoyancy on kinematic features of whole-body reaching underwater and compared them with those produced on land. Eight professional divers were asked to perform arm reaching movements toward visual targets while standing. Targets were presented either close or far from the subjects (requiring in the latter case an additional whole-body displacement). Reaching movements were performed on land or underwater in two different contexts of buoyancy. The divers either wore a diving suit only with neutral buoyancy applied to their center of mass or were additionally equipped with a submersible simulated space suit with neutral buoyancy applied to their body limbs. Results showed that underwater exposure impacted basic movement features, especially movement speed which was reduced. However, movement kinematics also differed according to the way buoyancy was exerted on the whole-body. When neutral buoyancy was applied to the center of mass only, some focal and postural components of whole-body reaching remained close to land observations, notably when considering the relative deceleration duration of arm elevation and concomitant forward trunk bending when reaching the far target. On the contrary, when neutral buoyancy was exerted on body segments, movement kinematics were close to those reported in weightlessness, as reflected by the arm deceleration phase and the whole-body forward displacement when reaching the far target. These results suggest that astronauts could benefit from the application of neutral buoyancy across the whole-body segments to optimize underwater training and acquire specific motor skills which will be used in space.

This enables us to count and to tabulate immersions of a circle in a sphere (spherical curves), extending results by Arnold and followers. Different options, where the circle and/or the sphere are/is oriented are considered in turn, following Arnold's classification of the different types of symmetries. We also consider the case of bicolorable and bicolored maps or immersions, where faces are bicolored. Our method extends to immersions of a circle in a higher genus Riemann surface. There the bicolorability is no longer automatic and has to be assumed. We thus have two separate countings in nonzero genus, that of bicolorable maps and that of general maps. We use a classical method of encoding maps in terms of permutations, on which the constraints of "one-componentness" and of a given genus may be applied. Depending on the orientation issue and on the bicolorability assumption, permutations for a map with n vertices live in S-4n or in S-2n. In a nutshell, our method reduces to the counting (or listing) of orbits of certain subset of S-4n (respectively, S-2n), under the action of the centralizer of a certain element of S-4n (respectively, S-2n). This is achieved either by appealing to a formula by Frobenius or by a direct enumeration of these orbits. Applications to knot theory are briefly mentioned.

J	Maljean-Dubois, Sandrine								The Paris Agreement: A New Step in the Gradual Evolution of Differential Treatment in the Climate Regime?								REVIEW OF EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE & INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW				25	2			151	160		10.1111/reel.12162			JUL 2016	2016	Among international environmental agreements, the early climate regime gave the best illustration of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The principle has been frequently invoked in the delicate negotiations on the future climate regime, and its role has gradually evolved. The 2010 Cancun Agreements promoted a type of self-differentiation which tended to blur the distinction between developing and developed countries. In the post-2020 negotiations, the notion of intended nationally determined contributions to be communicated by each party took this approach further. However, differentiation was still at the core of discussions. The Paris Agreement represents a fine balance between the requirements of differentiation and ambition. Differentiation has grown both in flexibility and adaptability. The Agreement marks a decisive step forward in the gradual blurring of country categories, and better takes into account diverse national circumstances, capabilities and vulnerabilities, all of which are by their very nature changing over time.

We use Hamiltonian methods to prove that the coercivity of a suitable second variation associated to a Pontryagin singular arc is sufficient to prove its strong-local optimality.

A criterion for linear stability of the uniform stationary state is established which, for basic examples in the literature, is equivalent to the standard condition on the coupling strength. We prove that, under this criterion, the Kuramoto order parameter, when evolved under the full nonlinear dynamics, asymptotically vanishes (with polynomial rate n) for every trajectory issued from a sufficiently small perturbation. The proof uses techniques from the Analysis of PDEs and closely follows recent proofs of the nonlinear Landau damping in the Vlasov equation and Vlasov-HMF model.

CEREBRAL CORTEX				26	7			3023	3035		10.1093/cercor/bhv123			JUL 2016	2016	Magnetic resonance imaging has proved to be suitable and efficient for in vivo investigation of the early process of brain gyrification in fetuses and preterm newborns but the question remains as to whether cortical-related measurements derived from both cases are comparable or not. Indeed, the developmental folding trajectories drawn up from both populations have not been compared so far, neither from cross-sectional nor from longitudinal datasets. The present study aimed to compare features of cortical folding between healthy fetuses and early imaged preterm newborns on a cross-sectional basis, over a developmental period critical for the folding process (21-36 weeks of gestational age [GA]). A particular attention was carried out to reduce the methodological biases between the 2 populations. To provide an accurate group comparison, several global parameters characterizing the cortical morphometry were derived. In both groups, those metrics provided good proxies for the dramatic brain growth and cortical folding over this developmental period. Except for the cortical volume and the rate of sulci appearance, they depicted different trajectories in both groups suggesting that the transition from into ex utero has a visible impact on cortical morphology that is at least dependent on the GA at birth in preterm newborns.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses of the MST in adults with CF as compared with the gold standard cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). METHODS: Participants performed an MST and a CPET on a cycle ergometer in random order. Oxygen (O-2) uptake ((V)Over dotO(2)), carbon dioxide (CO2) retention (end-tidal PCO2; PETCO2), minute ventilation, heart rate, and peripheral O-2 saturation (SpO(2)) were continuously monitored. Whole blood lactate, dyspnea, and leg discomfort were recorded immediately after both exercises. RESULTS: Twenty patients with CF (aged 33 +/- 8 years; forced expiratory volume in 1 second = 48% +/- 17%) completed both tests. Peak values for (V)Over dotO(2) (27 +/- 7 vs 24 +/- 6 mL/kg/min), heart rate (169 +/- 19 vs 163 +/- 16 bpm), end PETCO2 (42 +/- 7 vs 39 +/- 8 mm Hg), and O-2 desaturation (end Sp O 2, 86% +/- 7% vs 90% +/- 6%) were significantly higher during the MST than during the CPET (all Ps<.05). Leg discomfort and whole blood lactate were significantly higher after the CPET (both Ps<.05). Thirty-five percent and 40% of patients showed significant O-2 desaturation and CO2 retention, respectively, during the MST, which was not detected during the CPET. A strong relationship was found between MST peak (V)Over dotO(2) and body weight walking distance product (r = 0.90; P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: The MST may provide a strong indicator of exercise tolerance in adults with CF as indicated by high peak (V)Over dotO(2) values. In clinical practice, body weight walking distance should be considered as the primary outcome. This test is also better than cycle ergometry CPET for detecting O-2 desaturation and CO2 retention, further emphasizing its clinical interest.

These materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Their photo-luminescence responses were analyzed under X-ray excitation. Rietveld refinements indicate that all the materials present a scheelite-type tetragonal structure. Micro-Raman spectra confirmed the formation of the solid solution with a specific effect due to Sr-O-Mo and Pb-O-Mo links in the scheelite structure. SEM images showed modifications in the shapes and grain sizes as x increased. Broad photoluminescent emission bands were observed in the energy range 2.1-2.9 eV. The emission bands were decomposed into four gaussian components. The intensities of all components presented a strong maximum in the composition range 0.1<x< 0.4. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chamroukhi, F.								Robust mixture of experts modeling using the t distribution								NEURAL NETWORKS				79				20	36		10.1016/j.neunet.2016.03.002			JUL 2016	2016	Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a popular framework for modeling heterogeneity in data for regression, classification, and clustering. For regression and cluster analyses of continuous data, MoE usually uses normal experts following the Gaussian distribution. However, for a set of data containing a group or groups of observations with heavy tails or atypical observations, the use of normal experts is unsuitable and can unduly affect the fit of the MoE model. We introduce a robust MoE modeling using the t distribution. The proposed t MoE (TMoE) deals with these issues regarding heavy-tailed and noisy data. We develop a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the proposed model by monotonically maximizing the observed data log-likelihood. We describe how the presented model can be used in prediction and in model-based clustering of regression data. The proposed model is validated on numerical experiments carried out on simulated data, which show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed model in terms of modeling non-linear regression functions as well as in model-based clustering. Then, it is applied to the real-world data of tone perception for musical data analysis, and the one of temperature anomalies for the analysis of climate change data. The obtained results show the usefulness of the TMoE model for practical applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The magnetic field model consists of an unperturbed reversed-shear (non-monotonic q-profile) helical part and a perturbation consisting of a superposition of modes. Contrary to most of the previous studies, the particle trajectories are computed by directly solving the full Lorentz force equations of motion in a six-dimensional phase space using a sixth-order, implicit, symplectic Gauss-Legendre method. The level of stochasticity in the particle orbits is diagnosed using averaged, effective Poincare sections. It is shown that when only one mode is present, the particle orbits can be stochastic even though the magnetic field line orbits are not stochastic (i.e., fully integrable). The lack of integrability of the particle orbits in this case is related to separatrix crossing and the breakdown of the global conservation of the magnetic moment. Some perturbation consisting of two modes creates resonance overlapping, leading to Hamiltonian chaos in magnetic field lines. Then, the particle orbits exhibit a nontrivial dynamics depending on their energy and pitch angle. It is shown that the regions where the particle motion is stochastic decrease as the energy increases. The non-monotonicity of the q-profile implies the existence of magnetic ITBs (internal transport barriers) which correspond to shearless flux surfaces located in the vicinity of the q-profile minimum. It is shown that depending on the energy, these magnetic ITBs might or might not confine particles. That is, magnetic ITBs act as an energy-dependent particle confinement filter. Magnetic field lines in reversed-shear configurations exhibit topological bifurcations (from homoclinic to heteroclinic) due to separatrix reconnection. We show that a similar but more complex scenario appears in the case of particle orbits that depend in a non-trivial way on the energy and pitch angle of the particles. Published by AIP Publishing.

This paper contributes to a comprehensive assessment of life history traits and fishery attributes of target and bycatch species caught by the tuna longline fishery in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Data was compiled on seven life history traits and three fishery attributes for 33 and 27 teleost stocks caught by longliners in South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively. In addition, each species was assigned into four categories describing the fate of the catch: target species for commercial use, bycatch species kept for consumption, bycatch species kept for commercial use and discarded bycatch. Life history traits and fishery attributes did not differ between oceans. However, non-target but commercialized species were smaller in the Atlantic Ocean. Teleosts caught by the tuna longline fishery was segregated into three main groups: (1) the fast growing species represented mainly by dolphinfishes (Coryphaena hippurus and C. equisellis), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), snoek (Thyrsites atun) and blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus); (2) target tunas and most other bycatch species which were part of an intermediate group and (3) billfishes including swordfish representing the large and slow growing species with moderate to high market values and unknown or highly uncertain stock status. Investment in some key life history traits (such as growth coefficient) and the development of quantitative or semi-quantitative approaches (stock assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment) should be priorized as precautionary management measures for these species.

We show that both the current autocorrelator (inside a single reservoir) and the current cross-correlator (between the two reservoirs) are expressed in terms of transmission amplitude and coefficient through the barriers. We identify the different energy-transfer processes involved in each contribution to the autocorrelator, and we highlight the fact that when there are several physical processes, the contribution results from a coherent superposition of scattering paths. Varying the gate and bias voltages, we discuss the profile of the differential Fano factor in light of recent experiments, and we identify the conditions for having a distinct value for the autocorrelator in the left and right reservoirs.

Evidence of atmospheric nanoparticle formation from emissions of marine microorganisms								GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS				43	12			6596	6603		10.1002/2016GL069389			JUN 28 2016	2016	Earth, as a whole, can be considered as a living organism emitting gases and particles into its atmosphere, in order to regulate its own temperature. In particular, oceans may respond to climate change by emitting particles that ultimately will influence cloud coverage. At the global scale, a large fraction of the aerosol number concentration is formed by nucleation of gas-phase species, but this process has never been directly observed above oceans. Here we present, using semicontrolled seawater-air enclosures, evidence that nucleation may occur from marine biological emissions in the atmosphere of the open ocean. We identify iodine-containing species as major precursors for new particle clusters' formation, while questioning the role of the commonly accepted dimethyl sulfide oxidation products, in forming new particle clusters in the region investigated and within a time scale on the order of an hour. We further show that amines would sustain the new particle formation process by growing the new clusters to larger sizes. Our results suggest that iodine-containing species and amines are correlated to different biological tracers.

ANTARES Collaboration; IceCube Collaboration; LIGO Sci Collaboration; Virgo Collaboration						High-energy neutrino follow-up search of gravitational wave event GW150914 with ANTARES and IceCube								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				93	12					122010	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.122010			JUN 23 2016	2016	We present the high-energy-neutrino follow-up observations of the first gravitational wave transient GW150914 observed by the Advanced LIGO detectors on September 14, 2015. We search for coincident neutrino candidates within the data recorded by the IceCube and ANTARES neutrino detectors. A possible joint detection could be used in targeted electromagnetic follow-up observations, given the significantly better angular resolution of neutrino events compared to gravitational waves. We find no neutrino candidates in both temporal and spatial coincidence with the gravitational wave event. Within +/- 500 s of the gravitational wave event, the number of neutrino candidates detected by IceCube and ANTARES were three and zero, respectively. This is consistent with the expected atmospheric background, and none of the neutrino candidates were directionally coincident with GW150914. We use this nondetection to constrain neutrino emission from the gravitational-wave event.		[Adrian-Martinez, S.; Ardid, M.; Felis, I.; Martinez-Mora, J.

Results demonstrate that the growth of SnO2 NRs is promoted by a compression of the nucleation rate parallel to the substrate and a decrease of the energy barrier for growth perpendicular to the substrate, which are controlled via the deposition conditions. This method provides both single-step formation of the SnO2 NRs and their integration with silicon micromachined platforms, but also allows for in-situ functionalization of the NRs with gold nanoparticles via co-deposition with a gold precursor. The functional properties are demonstrated for gas sensing, with microsensors using functionalised NRs demonstrating enhanced sensing properties towards H-2 compared to those based on non-functionalised NRs.

X-ray Excited Optical Fluorescence and Diffraction Imaging of Reactivity and Crystallinity in a Zeolite Crystal: Crystallography and Molecular Spectroscopy in One								ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION				55	26			7496	7500		10.1002/anie.201601796			JUN 20 2016	2016	Structure-activity relationships in heterogeneous catalysis are challenging to be measured on a single-particle level. For the first time, one X-ray beam is used to determine the crystallographic structure and reactivity of a single zeolite crystal. The method generates mm-resolved X-ray diffraction (m-XRD) and X-ray excited optical fluorescence (m-XEOF) maps of the crystallinity and Bronsted reactivity of a zeolite crystal previously reacted with a styrene probe molecule. The local gradients in chemical reactivity (derived from m-XEOF) were correlated with local crystallinity and framework Al content, determined by m-XRD.

David; Lucini, Biagio; Piai, Maurizio								Large mass hierarchies from strongly-coupled dynamics								JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS					6					114	10.1007/JHEP06(2016)114			JUN 20 2016	2016	Besides the Higgs particle discovered in 2012, with mass 125 GeV, recent LHC data show tentative signals for new resonances in diboson as well as diphoton searches at high center-of-mass energies (2 TeV and 750 GeV, respectively). If these signals are confirmed (or other new resonances are discovered at the TeV scale), the large hierarchies between masses of new bosons require a dynamical explanation. Motivated by these tentative signals of new physics, we investigate the theoretical possibility that large hierarchies in the masses of glueballs could arise dynamically in new strongly-coupled gauge theories extending the standard model of particle physics. We study lattice data on non-Abelian gauge theories in the (near-)conformal regime as well as a simple toy model in the context of gauge/gravity dualities. We focus our attention on the ratio R between the mass of the lightest spin-2 and spin-0 resonances, that for technical reasons is a particularly convenient and clean observable to study. For models in which (non-perturbative) large anomalous dimensions arise dynamically, we show indications that this mass ratio can be large, with R > 5. Moreover, our results suggest that R might be related to universal properties of the IR fixed point. Our findings provide an interesting step towards understanding large mass ratios in the non-perturbative regime of quantum field theories with (near) IR conformal behaviour.

The experimental protocol used to induce stress in a basketball free throw was the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and its control condition (Placebo-TSST). Participants (n = 19), novice basketball players but trained sportspersons, were exposed to two counterbalanced conditions in a crossover design. They were equipped with sensors to measure movement execution, while salivary cortisol and psychological state were also measured. The task consisted of two sequences of 40 free throws, one before either the TSST or Placebo-TSST and one after. Physiological and psychological measures evidenced that the TSST induced significant stress responses, whereas the Placebo-TSST did not. Shooting performance remained stable after the TSST but decreased after the Placebo-TSST. We found no effect of the TSST or Placebo-TSST on movement execution. A multivariate model of free throw performance demonstrated that timing, smoothness and explosiveness of the movements are more relevant to account for beginner's behavior than stress-related physiological and psychological states. We conclude that the TSST is a suitable protocol to induce stress responses in sport context, even though the effects on beginners' free throw performance and execution are small and complex.

The reported mechanical properties included the Young's modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break from tensile tests and the storage and loss modulus and glass transition temperature from DMA. The anion exchange membranes behaved as stiff polymers with Young's modulus in the order of 1 GPa, relatively with high strength (about 30 MPa) and low elongation at break (around 10%) was observed. Tensile tests were also made with membranes exchanged with hydrogen-carbonate and carbonate anions to control the absence of important carbonation of the OH form. The glass transition temperatures were of the order of 150 degrees C (PSU-TMA) or 200 degrees C (PSU-DABCO) for the hydroxide form, confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry; they increase further by about 50 K, when hydroxide ions are replaced by chloride. This result and the increase of the storage modulus could be interpreted by the higher hydration of hydroxide ions and the plasticizing effect of water, which reduced the Van der Waals interactions between the macromolecular chains.

Our aims were (i) to evaluate the links between the chemical environment as a whole and microbial diversity in the benthic compartment, and (ii) to compare the contributions of anthropogenic and natural chemical gradients to microbial diversity shifts. We studied surface sediments from 54 sampling sites in the semi-enclosed Toulon Bay (NW Mediterranean) exposed to high anthropogenic pressure. Previously published chemical data were completed by new measurements, resulting in an in depth geochemical characterization by 29 representative environmental variables. Bacterial and archaeal diversity was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profiling on a selection of samples distributed along chemical gradients. Multivariate statistical analyses explained from 45% to 80% of the spatial variation in microbial diversity, considering only the chemical variables. A selection of trace metals of anthropogenic origin appeared to be strong structural factors for both bacterial and archaeal communities. Bacterial terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) richness correlated strongly with both anthropogenic and natural chemical gradients, whereas archaeal T-RF richness demonstrated fewer links with chemical variables. No significant decrease in diversity was evidenced in relation to chemical contamination, suggesting a high adaptive potential of benthic microbial communities in Toulon Bay. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

James								Quantifying social contacts in a household setting of rural Kenya using wearable proximity sensors								EPJ DATA SCIENCE				5						21	10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0084-2			JUN 14 2016	2016	Close proximity interactions between individuals influence how infections spread. Quantifying close contacts in developing world settings, where such data is sparse yet disease burden is high, can provide insights into the design of intervention strategies such as vaccination. Recent technological advances have enabled collection of time-resolved face-to-face human contact data using radio frequency proximity sensors. The acceptability and practicalities of using proximity devices within the developing country setting have not been investigated. We present and analyse data arising from a prospective study of 5 households in rural Kenya, followed through 3 consecutive days. Pre-study focus group discussions with key community groups were held. All residents of selected households carried wearable proximity sensors to collect data on their close (< 1.5 metres) interactions. Data collection for residents of three of the 5 households was contemporaneous. Contact matrices and temporal networks for 75 individuals are defined and mixing patterns by age and time of day in household contacts determined. Our study demonstrates the stability of numbers and durations of contacts across days. The contact durations followed a broad distribution consistent with data from other settings. Contacts within households occur mainly among children and between children and adults, and are characterised by daily regular peaks in the morning, midday and evening. Inter-household contacts are between adults and more sporadic when measured over several days. Community feedback indicated privacy as a major concern especially regarding perceptions of non-participants, and that community acceptability required thorough explanation of study tools and procedures. Our results show for a low resource setting how wearable proximity sensors can be used to objectively collect high-resolution temporal data without direct supervision. The methodology appears acceptable in this population following adequate community engagement on study procedures. A target for future investigation is to determine the difference in contact networks within versus between households. We suggest that the results from this study may be used in the design of future studies using similar electronic devices targeting communities, including households and schools, in the developing world context.

Presenting the model under the name of black hole fireworks, they claim that the accumulation of quantum gravitational effects outside the horizon can cause the tunneling of geometry from a black hole to a white hole, allowing a bounce of the collapsing star which can eventually go back to infinity. In this paper, we discuss the instabilities of this model and propose a simple minimal modification which eliminates them, as well as other related instabilities discussed in the literature. The new scenario is a time-asymmetric version of the original model with a time scale for the final explosion that is shorter than m log m in Planck units. Our analysis highlights the importance of irreversibility in gravitational collapse which, in turn, uncovers important issues that cannot be addressed in detail without a full quantum gravity treatment.

For this purpose, killed cells of the diatom Chaetoceros neogracilis RCC2022 were irradiated (photosynthetically active radiation) at 36 and 446 J . s(-1) . m(-2) (for the same cumulative dose of irradiation energy) and at two temperatures (7 degrees C and 17 degrees C). Analyses of specific lipid tracers (fatty acids and sterols) revealed that low temperatures and irradiances increased photooxidative damages of monounsaturated lipids (i.e., palmitoleic acid, cholesterol and campesterol). The high efficiency of type II photosensitized degradation processes was attributed to: (i) the relative preservation of the sensitizer (chlorophyll) at low irradiances allowing a longer production of singlet oxygen and (ii) the slow diffusion rate of singlet oxygen through membranes at low temperatures inducing more damages. Conversely, high temperatures and irradiances induced (i) a rapid degradation of the photosensitizer and a loss of singlet oxygen by diffusion outside the membranes (limiting type II photosensitized oxidation), and (ii) intense autoxidation processes degrading unsaturated cell lipids and oxidation products used as photodegradation tracers. Our results may explain the paradoxical relationship observed in situ between latitude and photodegradation state of phytoplankton cells.

Accurate knowledge of photon heating in structure materials and irradiation devices is necessary for JHR design and safety studies. In this paper, we quantify the impact of different photon-heating calculation routes by comparing absorbed dose and Kinetic Energy Released per MAss (KERMA) calculations from two different Monte Carlo codes, TRIPOLI-4.9 and Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNP). These calculations are carried out in JHR-representative geometries with the nuclear-data library JEFF3.1.1 and the photon-data library EPDL97. Discrepancies amounting to up to 18% between absorbed dose and KERMA are found in JHR irradiation devices and are linked to charged-particle transport effects taking place in heterogeneous materials of small dimensions. In a JHR-assembly cell, discrepancies of about 1% on photon KERMA and of about 3% on absorbed dose are highlighted between the two Monte Carlo codes. These latter discrepancies are small compared to typical sources of uncertainty for Monte Carlo calculation (for instance, nuclear data uncertainty) and are supposed to be due to differences in the processing of gamma-production data by neutron interactions and to differences in electromagnetic-shower models and implementation between the two codes.

In particular the quantification of nuclear heating allows the prediction of heat and thermal conditions induced in irradiated devices and/or structural materials. Various sensors are used to quantify this parameter, in particular radiometric calorimeters, also known as in-pile calorimeters. Two main kinds of in-pile calorimeter exist possessing two geometries and two measurement principles: the single-cell calorimeter and the differential calorimeter. The present work focuses on specific examples of these calorimeter types, from the step of their out-of-pile calibration (transient and steady experiments respectively) to the comparison between numerical and experimental results obtained from two irradiation campaigns (French and Polish reactors). The main aim of this paper is to propose a steady numerical approach to estimate the single-cell calorimeter response under irradiation conditions.

J	Mastrandrea, Rossana; Barrat, Alain								How to Estimate Epidemic Risk from Incomplete Contact Diaries Data?								PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY				12	6					e1005002	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005002			JUN 2016	2016	Social interactions shape the patterns of spreading processes in a population. Techniques such as diaries or proximity sensors allow to collect data about encounters and to build networks of contacts between individuals. The contact networks obtained from these different techniques are however quantitatively different. Here, we first show how these discrepancies affect the prediction of the epidemic risk when these data are fed to numerical models of epidemic spread: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and overestimation of contact durations in contact diaries with respect to sensor data determine indeed important differences in the outcomes of the corresponding simulations with for instance an enhanced sensitivity to initial conditions. Most importantly, we investigate if and how information gathered from contact diaries can be used in such simulations in order to yield an accurate description of the epidemic risk, assuming that data from sensors represent the ground truth. The contact networks built from contact sensors and diaries present indeed several structural similarities: this suggests the possibility to construct, using only the contact diary network information, a surrogate contact network such that simulations using this surrogate network give the same estimation of the epidemic risk as simulations using the contact sensor network. We present and compare several methods to build such surrogate data, and show that it is indeed possible to obtain a good agreement between the outcomes of simulations using surrogate and sensor data, as long as the contact diary information is complemented by publicly available data describing the heterogeneity of the durations of human contacts.

J	Drezdner, Rachel; Anaut, Marie; Cyrulnik, Boris								Intergenerational approach of the Shoah memory: A differentiated transmission in the bosom of the family								ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES				174	5			352	358		10.1016/j.amp.2015.09.016			JUN 2016	2016	In more of 80% of the cases seen in my thesis research, we see a strong wish not to transmit stories about the Shoah: transmitting this equals transmitting death. I speak about "un axe de l'entente transgenerationnelle". Sometimes, transmission is late. The "children" are front of aged parents (more than 80) when a dialogue begins. Our research focuses on the complex dynamics of the intergenerational relationships, within the framework of the transmission of the memory of the Shoah and particularly in one very special family. The conclusions cannot be generalized, but make us think about the complexity of transmission of Shoah. The transmission of the Shoah in between two successive generations is not only influenced by the history and the emotions described, but it also involves specificities in the modes of transmission within the family. What are we saying to each of our children? How is the message being received? The transmission clearly depends on the level of the trauma in personal stories, though not exclusively so. Parent's discourse varies, sometimes considerably, from one child to another. What is passed on from parents' story to children can differ from one sibling to another. In this article, we choose to analysis a complex family situation, which highlights the differences in the intergenerational transmissions between a mother and her two sons. In this article, the mother in question is about 99, and her two children are 70 and 68. She began to speak when she was 85. Two films are issued from her story. Objectives.-The aim of this research is to study two modes of transmission of the experience of the Shoah, from the generation who lived it to the next and to try to understand the complexity of this transmission within a family. We more particularly centered on the analysis of the modes of exchanges between both dyads "mother elder son" and "mother younger son". Method.-This research is supported on some complementary data collections: the study shows that the transmission between the mother and her children is very differentiated with each son. Cross-referencing the data shows very specifically interactions in the two dyads and real differences in the way of relating between the mother and each child. They attest about the complexity of the intergenerational transmission about the Shoah within a family. Results.-(1) The mother orientates her discourse: the oldest specially receives negative words without nuances. For the youngest transmission it is more complex because more nuanced, and sometimes positive. (2) The oldest makes himself as a recipient of his mother words, as well as the second takes more distances with his mother's chosen words. Conclusions.-Transmission is not monolithic. The mother orientates her discourse. She chose to transmit to the oldest (in this story) the dark and mortifying side from her experience of the Shoah. This child became the recipient of her anxiety and her nightmares. On the contrary, she speaks with a lot of humor and nuances of her adventures in the Resistance to the second child, and he knows in his analysis of her discourse, how to take distances.

The finite sample is defined by restricting h to a finite interval and the conductance refers to the charge current across the sample in the open quantum system obtained by attaching independent electronic reservoirs to the sample ends. Our main result is that the conductances associated to an energy interval are non-vanishing in the limit iff .

The fuzzy control is developed by using the inverted fuzzy model. Due the number of climatic variables and to the condition of having a monotonic fuzzy model, there were used two membership functions for the fuzzy partition of each variable. It was used a fuzzy singleton model which is tuned by using batch least squares and updated with recursive least squares. The control actuators are: a proportional servo-valve for the heating, it works at nights when frozen can occur, and the ventilation, it is used during the day to avoid high temperatures, these signals are excluding mutually because the humidity or hot air can be lost generating an extra cost. The greenhouse is used for tomatoes cultivation. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a first step, poly(ether ether ketone) was sulfonated. The sulfonic acid groups were then transformed into chlorosulfonic moieties by reaction with thionyl chloride. A proportion of the chlorosulfonic functionalities reacted with dimethylamine to give basic sulfonamide groups, whereas those remaining were hydrolyzed back to sulfonate moieties obtaining, after immersion in acidic solution, an ampholytic polymer. The thermal, mechanical, electrical, and permeability properties of these amphoteric membranes were characterized. These membranes exhibit good thermal and mechanical stability and ultra-low vanadium ion permeability. The type and value of ion conductivity can be adjusted by the choice of acidic or basic medium. The tunable ion conductivity and the low ion permeability are suitable characteristics for the development of high-performance separator membranes.

Eight compounds were isolated and their chemical structures characterized by spectroscopic techniques (NMR, MS) and comparison with literature data. The phytochemical composition of the extracts of T. atomaria was found to be mainly attributable to sesquiterpenes. Accordingly, a new germacrane, germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-9-ol (1), is described together with five other sesquiterpenoids (-)-gleenol (2); alpha-cadinol methyl ether (3), (-)-trans-calamenene (4), (1S, 5E, 7S) 1-acetoxygermacra-4(15),5,10(14)-triene (5), and 4-peroxymuurol-5-ene (6). Moreover, two lipidic compounds, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, (5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z, 17Z)-eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic acid (7), and a glycerol derivative, sn-3-O-(geranylgeranyl)glycerol (8), were also isolated. The known compounds 3, 6-7 are described here for the first time from this alga. In comparison with commercial antifoulants [tributyltin oxide (TBTO), zineb, and copper pyrithione (CuPT)], compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 were evaluated for their toxicity and capacity to inhibit the settlement of five bacteria isolated from marine biofilms. Toxicity and anti-settlement activity of 1, 2, and 6 were also assessed against two barnacle species (Amphibalanus amphitrite and Balanus perforatus). Regarding bacteria, a significant anti-adhesion effect was recorded for 8 (EC50 between 25 and 50 mu M) with moderate associated toxicity. Considering the settlement inhibition of barnacle cyprids, (-)-gleenol (2) exhibited a strong AF efficacy (EC50 < 5 mu M) with moderate toxicity. In addition, as B. perforatus showed similar responses to the reference A. amphitrite with all compounds, this species may be proposed as an alternative model for anti-macrofouling assessment, especially in temperate areas. Overall, these results suggest that a number of the tested compounds could, alone or in combination, play a critical role in limiting the fouling at the T. atomaria surface.

On the growth and form of cortical convolutions								NATURE PHYSICS				12	6			588	593		10.1038/NPHYS3632			JUN 2016	2016	The rapid growth of the human cortex during development is accompanied by the folding of the brain into a highly convoluted structure(1-3). Recent studies have focused on the genetic and cellular regulation of cortical growth(4-8), but understanding the formation of the gyral and sulcal convolutions also requires consideration of the geometry and physical shaping of the growing brain(9-15). To study this, we use magnetic resonance images to build a 3D-printed layered gel mimic of the developing smooth fetal brain; when immersed in a solvent, the outer layer swells relative to the core, mimicking cortical growth. This relative growth puts the outer layer into mechanical compression and leads to sulci and gyri similar to those in fetal brains. Starting with the same initial geometry, we also build numerical simulations of the brain modelled as a soft tissue with a growing cortex, and show that this also produces the characteristic patterns of convolutions over a realistic developmental course. All together, our results show that although many molecular determinants control the tangential expansion of the cortex, the size, shape, placement and orientation of the folds arise through iterations and variations of an elementary mechanical instability modulated by early fetal brain geometry.

To test the hypothesis that this coordinated activation can be modified, we determined the effect of the upside-down posture compared with standing and lying supine. Subjects (n=14) breathed through a pneumotachometer with calibrated inductance bands around the chest wall and abdomen. Surface electromyographic activity (EMG) was recorded from the scalene muscles. Crural diaphragmatic EMG and oesophageal and gastric pressures were measured in a subset of six subjects. Quiet breathing and standard lung function manoeuvres were performed. The upside-down posture reduced end-expiratory lung volume. During quiet breathing, for the same inspiratory airflow and tidal volume, ribcage contribution decreased, abdominal contribution increased and transdiaphragmatic pressure swing doubled in the upside-down posture compared to standing (p < 0.05). Despite this, crural diaphragm EMG was unchanged, whereas scalene muscle EMG was reduced by half (p <0.05). Thus, the mechanical effect of an upside-down posture differentially affects inspiratory muscle activation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fernandez								An Agar-Based Method for Plating Marine Protozoan Parasites of the Genus Perkinsus								PLOS ONE				11	5					e0155015	10.1371/journal.pone.0155015			MAY 5 2016	2016	The genus Perkinsus includes protozoan parasites of mollusks responsible for losses in the aquaculture industry and hampering the recovery of natural shellfish beds worldwide, and they are a key taxon for understanding intracellular parasitism adaptations. The ability to propagate the parasite in liquid media, in the absence of the host, has been crucial for improving understanding of its biology; however, alternative techniques to grow the parasite are needed to explore other basic aspects of the Perkinsus spp. biology. We optimized a DME: Ham's F12-5% FBS-containing solid agar medium for plating Perkinsus marinus. This solid medium supported trophozoite propagation both by binary fission and schizogony. Colonies were visible to the naked eye 17 days after plating. We tested the suitability of this method for several applications, including the following: 1) Subcloning P. marinus isolates: single discrete P. marinus colonies were obtained from DME: Ham's F12-5% FBS-0.75% agar plates, which could be further propagated in liquid medium; 2) Subcloning engineered Perkinsus mediterraneus MOE[MOE]: GFP by streaking cultures on plates; 3) Chemical susceptibility: Infusing the DME: Ham's F12-5% FBS-0.75% agar plates with triclosan resulted in inhibition of the parasite propagation in a dose-dependent manner.

J	Hansen, Clint; Rezzoug, Nasser; Gorce, Philippe; Venture, Gentiane; Isableu, Brice								Sequence-dependent rotation axis changes and interaction torque use in overarm throwing								JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES				34	9			878	885		10.1080/02640414.2015.1076167			MAY 2 2016	2016	We examined the role of rotation axes during an overarm throwing task. Participants performed such task and were asked to throw a ball at maximal velocity at a target. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the minimum inertia axis would be exploited during the throwing phases, a time when internal-external rotations of the shoulder are particularly important. A motion capture system was used to evaluate the performance and to compute the potential axes of rotation (minimum inertia axis, shoulder-centre of mass axis and the shoulder-elbow axis). More specifically, we investigated whether a velocity-dependent change in rotational axes can be observed in the different throwing phases and whether the control obeys the principle of minimum inertia resistance. Our results showed that the limbs' rotational axis mainly coincides with the minimum inertia axis during the cocking phase and with the shoulder-elbow axis during the acceleration phase. Besides these rotation axes changes, the use of interaction torque is also sequence-dependent. The sequence-dependent rotation axes changes associated with the use of interaction torque during the acceleration phase could be a key factor in the production of hand velocity at ball release.

On the Use of X-Band Weather Radar for Wind Field Retrieval in Coastal Zone								JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY				33	5			899	917		10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0206.1			MAY 2016	2016	This paper documents the study of the radar signature of the sea surface on the images collected by an X-band weather radar and its application to remote sensing of the coastal zone. The main radar parameters considered here are the reflectivity factor [which was converted into a normalized radar cross section (NRCS)], the differential reflectivity, and the mean radial velocity. Measurements of the NRCS in the vicinity of an instrumented offshore buoy allowed for identifying its variations with wind speed and relative direction, which are found to be consistent with the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) model and other measurements. A more accurate empirical model for the NRCS is developed. For moderate to strong winds, the mean radial velocity is linearly related to the radial component of the wind speed, showing the potentiality of weather radars to map the radial surface wind speed at the scale of a basin. The influence of surface currents is weak here but should be likely taken into account in other places with stronger currents. Measurements of the differential reflectivity are also consistent with other measurements made elsewhere for the polarization ratio. The analysis of radar data over the entire coverage could also be performed using surface wind estimates from a meteorological model. Similar but less accurate results are obtained for the NRCS and the mean radial velocity. The extra spatial variability not due to wind speed variations is identified. An inversion procedure is proposed to recover the wind vector field from radar measurements after calibration of the NRCS values. Results are promising and pave the way to the concept of weather radar for ocean remote sensing.

We show that both the figure of merit and the efficiency can be written in term of noise and we highlight the central role played by the correlator between the charge current and the heat current that we call the mixed noise. After giving the expression of this quantity as an integral over energy, we calculate it, first in the linear response regime, next in the limit of small transmission through the barriers (Schottky regime) and finally in the intermediate regime. We discuss the notion of efficiency fluctuations and we also see here that the mixed noise comes into play.

Electron interferometry in integer quantum Hall edge channels								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										054008	10.1088/1742-5468/2016/05/054008			MAY 2016	2016	We consider the electronic analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer from quantum optics. In this realistic condensed matter device, single electrons are injected and travel along opposite chiral edge states of the integer quantum Hall effect, colliding at a quantum point contact (QPC). We monitor the fate of the colliding excitations by calculating zero-frequency current correlations at the output of the QPC. In the simpler case of filling factor nu = 1, we recover the standard result of a dip in the current noise as a function of the time delay between electron injections. For simultaneous injection, the current correlations exactly vanish, as dictated by the Pauli principle. This picture is however dramatically modified when interactions are present, as we show in the case of a filling factor nu = 2. There, each edge state is made out of two co-propagating channels, leading to charge fractionalization, and ultimately to decoherence. The latter phenomenon reduces the degree of indistinguishability between the two electron wavepackets, yielding a reduced contrast in the HOM signal. This naturally brings about the question of stronger interaction, offering a natural extension of the present work to the case of the fractional quantum Hall effect where many open and fascinating questions remain.

The calculations are performed within the framework of the Keldysh Green's function formalism in the wide band approximation limit. We establish the general formula for NS-FF noise for any values of temperature, frequency and bias voltage. The electron transfer processes from one to the other reservoir act via the transmission amplitude and transmission coefficient depending on the energy. By taking the symmetrized version of this expression, we show that our result coincides with the expression of the finite frequency noise obtained by Buttiker using the scattering theory. We also give the explicit analytical expression for the NS-FF noise in the zero temperature limit. Finally, by performing numerical calculations, we discuss the evolution of the NS-FF noise spectrum with varying temperature, dot energy level, and coupling strength to the reservoirs, revealing a large variety of behaviors such as different symmetry properties and changes of sign in the excess noise.

The circuit has been integrated in a ST-Microelectronics CMOS 0.13 mu m technology with a supply voltage of 1.2 V on a die area of 0.56 mm(2). A power manager is used to reduce the power leakages to 3.91 mu W which gives a power consumption of 3.98 Mw at 10 kb/s.

J	Wurl, Oliver; Stolle, Christian; Chu Van Thuoc; Pham The Thu; Mari, Xavier								Biofilm-like properties of the sea surface and predicted effects on air-sea CO2 exchange								PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY				144				15	24		10.1016/j.pocean.2016.03.002			MAY 2016	2016	Because the sea surface controls various interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere, it has a profound function for marine biogeochemistry and climate regulation. The sea surface is the gateway for the exchange of climate-relevant gases, heat and particles. Thus, in order to determine how the ocean and the atmosphere interact and respond to environmental changes on a global scale, the characterization and understanding of the sea surface are essential. The uppermost part of the water column is defined as the sea-surface microlayer and experiences strong spatial and temporal dynamics, mainly due to meteorological forcing. Wave-damped areas at the sea surface are caused by the accumulation of surface-active organic material and are defined as slicks. Natural slicks are observed frequently but their biogeochemical properties are poorly understood. In the present study, we found up to 40 times more transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), the foundation of any biofilm, in slicks compared to the underlying bulk water at multiple stations in the North Pacific, South China Sea, and Baltic Sea. We found a significant lower enrichment of TEP (up to 6) in non-slick sea surfaces compared to its underlying bulk water. Moreover, slicks were characterized by a large microbial biomass, another shared feature with conventional biofilms on solid surfaces. Compared to non-slick samples (avg. pairwise similarity of 70%), the community composition of bacteria in slicks was increasingly (avg. pairwise similarity of 45%) different from bulk water communities, indicating that the TEP-matrix creates specific environments for its inhabitants. We, therefore, conclude that slicks can feature biofilm-like properties with the excessive accumulation of particles and microbes. We also assessed the potential distribution and frequency of slick-formation in coastal and oceanic regions, and their effect on air sea CO2 exchange based on literature data. We estimate that slicks can reduce CO2 fluxes by up to 15%, and, therefore, play important local and regional roles in regulating air sea interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The genetic analyses (16S rRNA genes, gyrB, recA, nreB and cur) confirmed that all strains are Burkholderia and cluster into two separated groups. The DNA hybridization results showed low relatedness values to the closest relatives Burkholderia species. The phenotypic analyses confirmed that the two groups of strains could be differentiated from each other and from other known Burkholderia species. This polyphasic study revealed that these two groups of strains represent each a novel species of Burkholderia, for which the names Burkholderia novacaledonica sp. nov. (type strain STM10272(T) = LMG28615(T) = CIP110887(T)) and B. ultramafica sp. nov. (type strain STM10279(T) = LMG28614(T) = CIP110886(T)) are proposed, respectively. These strains of Burkholderia presented specific ecological traits such as the tolerance to the extreme edaphic constraints of ultramafic soils: they grew at pH between 4 and 8 and tolerate the strong unbalanced Ca/Mg ratio (1/19) and the high concentrations of heavy metals i.e. Co, Cr, Mn and Ni. Noteworthy B. ultramafica tolerated nickel until 10mM and B. novacaledonica up to 5 mM. The presence of the nickel (nreB) and cobalt/nickel (cnr) resistance determinants encoding for protein involved in metal tolerance was found in all strains of both groups. Moreover, most of the strains were able to produce plant growth promoting molecules (ACC, IAA, NH3 and siderophores). Such ecological traits suggest that these new species of Burkholderia might be environmentally adaptable plant-associated bacteria and beneficial to plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Characterization of aerosols above the Northern Adriatic Sea: Case studies of offshore and onshore wind conditions								ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT				132				153	162		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.02.044			MAY 2016	2016	Aerosol particles in coastal areas result from a complex mixing between sea spray aerosols locally generated at the sea surface by the wind-waves interaction processes and a continental component resulting from natural and/or anthropogenic sources. This paper presents a physical and chemical analysis of the aerosol data acquired from May to September 2014 in the Adriatic Sea. Aerosol distributions were measured on the Acqua Alta platform located 15 km off the coast of Venice using two Particle Measuring System probes and a chemical characterization was made using an Ion Chromatography analysis (IC). Our aim is to study both the sea-spray contribution and the anthropogenic influence in the coastal aerosol of this Mediterranean region. To this end, we focus on a comparison between the present data and the aerosol size distributions measured south of the French Mediterranean coast. For air masses of marine origin transported by southern winds on the French coast and by the Sirocco in the Adriatic, we note a good agreement between the concentrations of super-micrometer aerosols measured in the two locations. This indicates a similar sea surface production of sea-spray aerosols formed by bubble bursting processes in the two locations. In contrast, the results show larger concentrations of submicron particles in the North-Western Mediterranean compared to the Adriatic, which result probably from a larger anthropogenic background for marine conditions. In contrast, for a coastal influence, the chemical analysis presented in the present paper seems to indicate a larger importance of the anthropogenic impact in the Northern Adriatic compared to the North-Western Mediterranean.

The maximum keratinase activity recorded after 24-h of incubation at 50 degrees C was 21000 U/ml. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation-dialysis and heat treatment (2 h at 50 degrees C) followed by UNO Q-6 FPLC anion exchange chromatography, and submitted to biochemical characterization assays. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis revealed that the purified enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 33246.10 Da. The sequence of the 23 N-terminal residues of KERCA showed high homology with those of bacterial keratinases. Optimal activity was achieved at pH 7 and 50 degrees C. The enzyme was completely inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and diiodopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP), which suggests that it belongs to the serine keratinase family. KERCA displayed higher levels of hydrolysis and catalytic efficiency than keratinase KERQ7 from Bacillus tequilensis strain Q7. These properties make KERCA a potential promising and eco-friendly alternative to the conventional chemicals used for the dehairing of goat, sheep, and bovine hides in the leather processing industry.

Unfortunately, in practice, few instances satisfy the BTP. We show that a local version of the BTP allows the merging of domain values in arbitrary instances of binary CSP, thus providing a novel polynomial-time reduction operation. Extensive experimental trials on benchmark instances demonstrate a significant decrease in instance size for certain classes of problems. We show that BTP-merging can be generalised to instances with constraints of arbitrary arity and we investigate the theoretical relationship with resolution in SAT. A directional version of general-arity BTP-merging then allows us to extend the BTP tractable class previously defined only for binary CSP. We investigate the complexity of several related problems including the recognition problem for the general-arity BTP class when the variable order is unknown, finding an optimal order in which to apply BTP merges and detecting BTP-merges in the presence of global constraints such as AllDifferent.

ANTARES Collaboration						A search for Secluded Dark Matter in the Sun with the ANTARES neutrino telescope								JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS					5					016	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/05/016			MAY 2016	2016	A search for Secluded Dark Matter annihilation in the Sun using 2007-2012 data of the ANTARES neutrino telescope is presented. Three different cases are considered: a) detection of dimuons that result from the decay of the mediator, or neutrino detection from: b) mediator that decays into a dimuon and, in turn, into neutrinos, and c) mediator that decays directly into neutrinos. As no significant excess over background is observed, constraints are derived on the dark matter mass and the lifetime of the mediator.

J	Dupuy, Christine; Pagano, Marc; Got, Patrice; Domaizon, Isabelle; Chappuis, Alexis; Marchessaux, Guillaume; Bouvy, Marc								Trophic relationships between metazooplankton communities and their plankton food sources in the Iles Eparses (Western Indian Ocean)								MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH				116				18	31		10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.02.011			MAY 2016	2016	Coral reef and atoll lagoons are among the most diversified marine ecosystems but also the most affected by the combined effects of climate change and human activities. The Iles Eparses (Scattered Islands) in the Western Indian Ocean have been little affected by human pressure and can be considered to be "pristine" ecosystems. Metazooplankton plays a major role in the functioning and productivity of aquatic ecosystems, and this study was undertaken: (i) to determine the spatial abundance, distribution and species composition of metazooplankton, (ii) to assess the effect of metazooplankton grazing on pico- and nanophytoplankton and (iii) to analyze the trophic positions of metazooplankton by using the stable isotope signatures of a wide variety of taxa and particulate organic matter from the Iles Eparses and Mayotte. Tromelin Island (which is not located in the Mozambique Channel) had the lowest metazooplankton abundance with no cyanobacteria Trichodesmium spp. or mollusks (pteropods) presence, and with delta N-15 signatures of organisms that were higher than for the islands in the Mozambique Channel. Trichodesmium spp. was found in the Mozambique Channel and the plankton food web was probably based preferentially on these cyanobacteria with lower delta N-15 signatures indicating direct or indirect trophic transfer of diazotrophic nitrogen to metazooplankton. Three of the islands were distinct: Europa had the highest proportion of copepods, with oithonids being dominant, which is typical of rich mangrove systems, while Juan de Nova and Mayotte seemed to be the sites most affected by human activity with a high abundance of appendicularians and distinct particulate organic matter partial derivative C-13 signatures. Grazing experiments showed that food could be a limiting factor for metazooplankton in the Iles Eparses. However, the effect of metazooplankton grazing on phytoplankton appeared to be very low (0.01-232% of the total phytoplankton per day). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An object-unified approach to develop controllers for autonomous underwater vehicles								MECHATRONICS				35				54	70		10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.12.011			MAY 2016	2016	This paper presents a novel approach, which is based on the integration of hybrid automata, real-time Unified Modeling Language (UML)/System Modeling Language (SysML) and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) in order to systematically develop controllers for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV5). This approach entirely covers the analysis, design, implementation and deployment phases focused on controllers for AUVs and also allows the designed control elements to be customizable and re-usable in the development of new applications of various AUV types. The paper brings out step-by-step the AUV dynamics together with the control structure, specializations of MDA's features such as the Computation Independent Model (CIM) with use-cases and hybrid automata, the Platform Independent Model (PIM) carried out by using the real-time UML, as well as its Platform Specific Model (PSM) implemented by sub-system paradigms and object-oriented mechanisms to completely perform the development lifecycle of AUV controllers. The transformation rules are then introduced and applied to convert the detailed design model of PIM into the implementation model of PSM by using open-source platforms in order to quickly simulate and realize AUV controllers. Based on this approach, a planar trajectory-tracking controller of a miniature autonomous submersible was completely developed and successfully taken on trial trip. In this application, the controller has been implemented with the simulation model in OpenModelica. The obtained simulation results then can permit us to mainly define the designed control elements and their properties, as well as building the implementation libraries for performing quickly the realization model in Arduino Mega2560 microcontroller.

J	Hucher, Nicolas; Fam, Papa Gueye								The role of speculation in international futures markets on commodity prices								RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE				37				49	65		10.1016/j.ribaf.2015.09.034			MAY 2016	2016	The role of futures contracts on spot prices has been one of the key focus areas of research since the recent surge in commodity prices and increase in the volatility of commodity returns. However, no consensus arises from this literature, and hence it is difficult to link the use of futures contracts in agricultural commodities by non-hedgers and the growing food insecurity within developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to highlight causal relationships from futures contracts to spot prices of underlying assets, namely agricultural commodities. As research that focus on exchange-traded funds do not provide any clear conclusions, we focus on the imbalance between short- and long-open positions, this imbalance being caused by the exchange traded funds' participation in futures markets. In this paper, we estimate relationships between financial variables including indicators for speculation in futures markets and the returns of cocoa, corn, soybean, wheat, coffee, rice, and sugar on a weekly basis from 1998 to 2013. Significant results lead to Granger causality tests that in turn validate the hypothesis of a positive impact of speculation in futures markets to returns on the underlying commodities.

The Eu3+ lattice sites controlled by co-doping with either K or Li were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The variation in integrated emission intensity and emission colour over the experimental matrix was examined using statistical tools, and the observed trends were rationalized based on the physical and electronic structure of the phosphors. Phosphors with Eu on B-site with maximum Sr content had remarkably higher emission intensities than all other materials, but the emission was more orange than red due to domination of the D-5(0) - F-7(1) (595 nm) transition of Eu3+. The relative intensities of the D-5(0) - F-7(2) (615 nm) and D-3(0) - F-7(1) transitions of Eu3+, and thus the red-shift of the emission, decreased linearly with increasing Sr content in the A-site Eu-substituted phosphors, and reached a maximum for Sr1.96Eu0.02K0.02CaW0.25Mo0.75O6. A maximum external quantum efficiency of 17% was obtained for the phosphor Sr2Ca0.7Eu0.15Li0.15W0.5Mo0.5O6 with Eu on B-site. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.		[Sletnes, M.; Wagner, N.

Physical exercise and burnout facets predict injuries in a population-based sample of French career firefighters								APPLIED ERGONOMICS				54				131	135		10.1016/j.apergo.2015.12.007			MAY 2016	2016	Although firefighting is known to engender a high rate of injury, few studies have examined the contribution of physical exercise, burnout and coping strategies to firefighting-related injuries. Data were collected from a population-based sample of 220 male firefighters. In a descriptive study, the nature and site of the injuries and the relationships among firefighter injuries, physical exercise, burnout and coping strategies were examined. Sprains were the most prevalent type of injury (98%), followed by tendinitis (40%) and muscle tears (30%). More than two thirds of these injuries were located at the ankle. Weekly hours of physical exercise, cognitive weariness at work, social support seeking, problem-focused coping and emotional exhaustion were significantly related to these injuries. The findings suggest that physical exercise and cognitive weariness can be considered as risk factors for French firefighter injuries, whereas problem-focused coping can be seen as a protective factor. More research is needed to explain the relationship between social support seeking and injury. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.

Using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, we obtain f(ud)(N) = 0.0405(40)(35) and f(s)(N) = 0.113(45)(40), which translates into sigma(pi N) = 38(3)(3) MeV, sigma(sN) = 105(41)(37) MeV, and y(N) = 0.20(8)(8) for the sigma terms and the related ratio, where the first errors are statistical and the second errors are systematic. Using isospin relations, we also compute the individual up and down quark contents of the proton and neutron (results in the main text).

While the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability in carbon export in these regions.

We have recently extend the range of applications of catalytic SPL (cSPL) by introducing a homogeneous catalyst immobilized on the apex of a scanning probe. Here we investigate the importance of atomic force microscopy (AFM) physical parameters (applied force, writing speed, and interline distance) on the resultant chemical activity in this cSPL methodology through the direct topographic observation of nanostructured surfaces. Indeed, an alkene-terminated self-assembled monolayer (alkene-SAM) on a silicon wafer was locally epoxidized using a scanning probe tip with a covalently grafted manganese complex bearing the 1,4,7-triazacyclononane macrocycle as the ligand. In a post-transformation process, N-octylpiperazine was covalently grafted to the surface via a selective nudeophilic ring-opening reaction. With this procedure, we could write various patterns on the surface with high spatial control. The catalytic AFM probe thus appears to be very robust because a total area close to 500 mu m(2) was patterned without any noticeable loss of catalytic activity. Finally, this methodology allowed us to reach a lower lateral line resolution down to 40 nm, thus being competitive and complementary to the other nanolithographical techniques for the nanostructuration of surfaces.

Weyl gravity and Cartan geometry								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				93	8					085032	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.085032			APR 25 2016	2016	We point out that the Cartan geometry known as the second-order conformal structure provides a natural differential geometric framework underlying gauge theories of conformal gravity. We are concerned with two theories: the first one is the associated Yang-Mills-like Lagrangian, while the second, inspired by [1], is a slightly more general one that relaxes the conformal Cartan geometry. The corresponding gauge symmetry is treated within the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin language. We show that the Weyl gauge potential is a spurious degree of freedom, analogous to a Stueckelberg field, that can be eliminated through the dressing field method. We derive sets of field equations for both the studied Lagrangians. For the second one, they constrain the gauge field to be the "normal conformal Cartan connection.'' Finally, we provide in a Lagrangian framework a justification of the identification, in dimension 4, of the Bach tensor with the Yang-Mills current of the normal conformal Cartan connection, as proved in [2].

Alongshore coastal currents and cyclonic gyres are the primary circulation features that connected regions in the Adriatic Sea. The historical drifter observations span 25 years and, thus, provide estimates of transport between regions realized by the mean surface circulation. The virtual particle trajectories and a dedicated drifter experiment show that southeasterly Sirocco winds can drive eastward cross-Adriatic transport from the Italian coast near the Gargano Promontory to the Dalmatian Islands in Croatia. Southeasterly winds disrupt alongshore transport on the west coast. Northwesterly Mistral winds enhanced east-to-west transport and resulted in stronger southeastward coastal currents in the western Adriatic current (WAC) and export to the northern Ionian Sea. The central Italian regions showed strong connections from north to south, likely realized by alongshore transport in the WAC. Alongshore, downstream transport was weaker on the east coast, likely due to the more complex topography introduced by the Dalmatian Islands of Croatia. Cross-Adriatic connection percentages were higher for east-to-west transport. Cross-Adriatic transport, in general, occurred via the cyclonic sub-gyres, with westward (eastward) transport observed in the northern (southern) arms of the central and southern gyres.

J	Fournet, Julie; Barrat, Alain								Epidemic risk from friendship network data: an equivalence with a non-uniform sampling of contact networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						24593	10.1038/srep24593			APR 15 2016	2016	Contacts between individuals play an important role in determining how infectious diseases spread. Various methods to gather data on such contacts co-exist, from surveys to wearable sensors. Comparisons of data obtained by different methods in the same context are however scarce, in particular with respect to their use in data-driven models of spreading processes. Here, we use a combined data set describing contacts registered by sensors and friendship relations in the same population to address this issue in a case study. We investigate if the use of the friendship network is equivalent to a sampling procedure performed on the sensor contact network with respect to the outcome of simulations of spreading processes: such an equivalence might indeed give hints on ways to compensate for the incompleteness of contact data deduced from surveys. We show that this is indeed the case for these data, for a specifically designed sampling procedure, in which respondents report their neighbors with a probability depending on their contact time. We study the impact of this specific sampling procedure on several data sets, discuss limitations of our approach and its possible applications in the use of data sets of various origins in data-driven simulations of epidemic processes.

Methods: Two hundred twenty male firefighters from 20 to 62 years old participated and mediation analyses were performed. Results: The results showed that neuroticism was positively related to the three dimensions of burnout, both directly and through mastery avoidance goals. Mastery approach goals mediated the relationships between conscientiousness and physical fatigue and between openness to experience and physical fatigue. Conclusion: Three of the Big Five personality traits, neuroticism, conscientiousness and openness to experience, and achievement goals, may be important factors in understanding and preventing firefighter burnout.

(Ocean Dyn 64:1447-1456, 2014), this article presents significant waveheights of swell inverted from a 13 month dataset of two high-frequency (HF) phased array radars. As an important intermediate variable in the calculation of significant waveheights, relative swell directions obtained by two different methods from a single radar station are also presented. The impact of the inaccuracy of relative swell direction on the calculation of waveheight is investigated and an alternative way of using constant swell direction is proposed. Radar-inverted swell significant waveheights using different ranges of relative swell directions are investigated. Results are assessed by WAVEWATCH III model hind casts. Analysis of the complete database shows that radar-inverted swell significant waveheights agree reasonably well with model estimates with large scatter. Standard deviation of the difference between the two estimations increases with waveheight, whereas the relative standard deviation, normalized by waveheight, keeps nearly constant. The constant direction scheme of waveheight inversion gives good estimations except for energetic swell exceeding the small perturbation assumption. Statistical analysis suggests that radar measurement uncertainty explains a considerable part of the difference between radar and model estimates. Swell estimates from both radar stations are consistent. This enables combined use of both radar spectra at common radar cells. Use of double spectra solves the ambiguity of relative swell direction, i.e., absolute swell direction is obtained, and effectively improves the accuracy of swell direction by the least-squares method.

In this paper, we consider the most general linear connection compatible with homogeneity and isotropy, but not necessarily with ametric. A light-cone structure is assigned by choosing a set of geodesics representing light rays. This defines a "scale factor" and a local notion of distance, as that travelled by light in a given proper time interval. We find that the velocities and relativistic energies of free-falling bodies decrease in time as a consequence of cosmic expansion, but at a rate that can be different than that dictated by the usual metric framework. By extrapolating this behavior to photons' redshift, we find that the latter is in principle independent of the "scale factor". Interestingly, redshift-distance relations and other standard geometric observables aremodified in this extended framework, in a way that could be experimentally tested. An extremely tight constraint on the model, however, is represented by the blackbody-ness of the cosmic microwave background. Finally, as a check, we also consider the effects of a non-metric connection in a different set-up, namely, that of a static, spherically symmetric spacetime.

From this comparison we found that, when the sampling is low (the average number of object per cell is around unity), it is necessary to use a parametric method to model the galaxy distribution. We used a set of mock catalogues of VIPERS to verify if we were able to reconstruct the cell-count probability distribution once the observational strategy is applied. We find that, in the simulated catalogues, the probability distribution of galaxies is better represented by a Gamma expansion than a skewed log-normal distribution. Finally, we correct the cell-count probability distribution function from the angular selection effect of the VIMOS instrument and study the redshift and absolute magnitude dependency of the underlying galaxy density function in VIPERS from redshift 0.5 to 1.1. We found a very weak evolution of the probability density distribution function and that it is well approximated by a Gamma distribution, independently of the chosen tracers.

MWA Collaboration; ANTARES Collaboration; TAROT Collaboration; ROTSE Collaboration						MURCHISON WIDEFIELD ARRAY LIMITS ON RADIO EMISSION FROM ANTARES NEUTRINO EVENTS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS				820	2					L24	10.3847/2041-8205/820/2/L24			APR 1 2016	2016	We present a search, using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), for electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to two candidate high-energy neutrino events detected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope in 2013 November and 2014 March. These events were selected by ANTARES because they are consistent, within 0 degrees.4, with the locations of galaxies within 20 Mpc of Earth. Using MWA archival data at frequencies between 118 and 182 MHz, taken similar to 20. days prior to, at the same time as, and up to a year after the neutrino triggers, we look for transient or strongly variable radio sources that are consistent with the neutrino positions. No such counterparts are detected, and we set a 5 sigma upper limit for low-frequency radio emission of similar to 10(37) erg s(-1) for progenitors at 20 Mpc. If the neutrino sources are instead not in nearby galaxies, but originate in binary neutron star coalescences, our limits place the progenitors at z greater than or similar to 0.2. While it is possible, due to the high background from atmospheric neutrinos, that neither event is astrophysical, the MWA observations are nevertheless among the first to follow up neutrino candidates in the radio, and illustrate the promise of wide-field instruments like MWA for detecting EM counterparts to such events.

A mass budget for mercury and methylmercury in the Arctic Ocean								GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES				30	4			560	575		10.1002/2015GB005280			APR 2016	2016	Elevated biological concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative neurotoxin, are observed throughout the Arctic Ocean, but major sources and degradation pathways in seawater are not well understood. We develop a mass budget for mercury species in the Arctic Ocean based on available data since 2004 and discuss implications and uncertainties. Our calculations show that high total mercury (Hg) in Arctic seawater relative to other basins reflect large freshwater inputs and sea ice cover that inhibits losses through evasion. We find that most net MeHg production (20Mga(-1)) occurs in the subsurface ocean (20-200m). There it is converted to dimethylmercury (Me2Hg: 17Mga(-1)), which diffuses to the polar mixed layer and evades to the atmosphere (14Mga(-1)). Me2Hg has a short atmospheric lifetime and rapidly degrades back to MeHg. We postulate that most evaded Me2Hg is redeposited as MeHg and that atmospheric deposition is the largest net MeHg source (8Mga(-1)) to the biologically productive surface ocean. MeHg concentrations in Arctic Ocean seawater are elevated compared to lower latitudes. Riverine MeHg inputs account for approximately 15% of inputs to the surface ocean (2.5Mga(-1)) but greater importance in the future is likely given increasing freshwater discharges and permafrost melt. This may offset potential declines driven by increasing evasion from ice-free surface waters. Geochemical model simulations illustrate that for the most biologically relevant regions of the ocean, regulatory actions that decrease Hg inputs have the capacity to rapidly affect aquatic Hg concentrations.

As revealed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, the thickness of the pristine graphene significantly influences the bonding configuration of the incorporated nitrogen atoms. Using the plasma gun, a high concentration of graphitic-nitrogen (3 at%) is obtained in N-doped bilayer graphene, while only 0.2 at% of pyridinic-nitrogen is incorporated. By contrast, a comparable amount of each nitrogen doping configuration is found with monolayer graphene. The integrity of the bilayer graphene is also better preserved than its monolayer counterpart after nitrogen plasma exposure, as evidenced by their inverse photoemission spectra. It is attributed to a better stability and a lower vacancy creation rate in bilayer graphene during plasma exposure. In addition, the N-doped bilayer graphene shows an efficient n-type doping, with a Dirac point brought 0.45 +/- 0.1 eV away from the Fermi energy. In brief, this study reports an efficient method for tailoring the electronic properties of graphene using industry-suited techniques, thereby promoting future graphene-based applications.

We consider the stability in the inverse problem of determining a time-dependent coefficient of order zero q, appearing in a Dirichlet initial-boundary value problem for a wave equation partial derivative(2)(t)u - Delta(x) u + q(t,x)u = 0 in Q, from partial observations on partial derivative Q. The observation is given by a boundary operator associated to the wave equation. Using suitable geometric optics solutions and Carleman estimates, we prove a stability estimate in the determination of q from the boundary operator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Possibilities for investigating the piezoelectric effect using microsized hard X-ray beams are demonstrated and perspectives for future dynamical measurements on PZT samples with variety of compositions and thicknesses are given. Studies performed on the crystalline [100, 110] directions evidenced piezoelectric anisotropy. The piezoelectric coefficient d(33) was calculated in terms of the lab reference frame (d(perp)) and found to be two times larger along the [100] direction than along the [110] direction. The absolute values for the d(perp) amount to 120 and 230 pm/V being in good agreement with experimental and theoretical values found in literature for bulk PZT ceramics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Touristic site attractiveness seen through Twitter								EPJ DATA SCIENCE				5						12	10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0073-5			MAR 25 2016	2016	Tourism is becoming a significant contributor to medium and long range travels in an increasingly globalized world. Leisure traveling has an important impact on the local and global economy as well as on the environment. The study of touristic trips is thus raising a considerable interest. In this work, we apply a method to assess the attractiveness of 20 of the most popular touristic sites worldwide using geolocated tweets as a proxy for human mobility. We first rank the touristic sites based on the spatial distribution of the visitors' place of residence. The Taj Mahal, the Pisa Tower and the Eiffel Tower appear consistently in the top 5 in these rankings. We then pass to a coarser scale and classify the travelers by country of residence. Touristic site's visiting figures are then studied by country of residence showing that the Eiffel Tower, Times Square and the London Tower welcome the majority of the visitors of each country. Finally, we build a network linking sites whenever a user has been detected in more than one site. This allow us to unveil relations between touristic sites and find which ones are more tightly interconnected.

Species Specificity of Bacteria Associated to the Brown Seaweeds Lobophora (Dictyotales, Phaeophyceae) and Their Potential for Induction of Rapid Coral Bleaching in Acropora muricata								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				7						316	10.3389/fmicb.2016.00316			MAR 21 2016	2016	While reef degradation is occurring worldwide, it is not uncommon to see phase shifts from coral to macroalgal dominated reefs. Numerous studies have addressed the mechanisms by which macroalgae may outcompete corals and a few recent studies highlighted the putative role of bacteria at the interface between macroalgae and corals. Some studies suggest that macroalgae may act as vectors and/or foster proliferation of microorganisms pathogenic for corals. Using a combination of high throughput sequencing, bacterial culturing, and in situ bioassays we question if the adversity of macroalgal associated bacteria to corals is mediated by specific bacterial taxa. Using Illumina sequencing, we characterized and compared the bacterial community from two Lobophora (Dictyotales, Phaeophyceae) species. The two species presented distinctive bacterial communities. Both species shared approximately half of their OTUs, mainly the most abundant bacteria. Species-specific OTUs belong to Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. In total, 16 culturable bacterial strain were isolated and identified from the Lobophora surface, consisting of 10 genera (from nine families, four classes, and three phyla), some of which are not known as, but are related to pathogens involved in coral diseases, and others are naturally associated to corals. When patches of marine agar with 24 h cultures of each of these bacteria were placed in direct contact with the branches of the scleractinian coral Acropora muricata, they caused severe bleaching after 24 h exposure. Results suggest that regardless of taxonomic affinities, increase in density of these bacteria can be adverse to corals. Nevertheless, the microbial community associated to macroalgal surface may not represent a threat to corals, because the specific bacterial screening and control exerted by the alga preventing specific bacterial proliferation.

Aqueous dispersion of multiwall carbon nanotubes with phosphonic acid derivatives								COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS				493				41	51		10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.01.028			MAR 20 2016	2016	The dispersing power of different phosphonic acid (PA) surfactants on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was examined: benzylphosphonic acid (BPA), hexylphosphonic acid (HPA) and decylphosphonic acid (DPA). UV-vis absorbance, transmission electron microscopy and zeta potential were employed to characterize the dispersion of MWCNTs in the aqueous phase. Among the three surfactants, DPA provided maximum dispersion stability while BPA and HPA provided minimum dispersion stability. We have shown that there exists an optimum weight ratio of surfactant to MWCNT of 1.5-1 for the effective dispersion of MWCNTs. The-potential values of the DPA-nanotube dispersion increased as the DPA concentration increased to reach a maximum value of-62 mV. The long hydrophobic chain of DPA was found to play a central role for the formation of stable MWCNT dispersions. The DPA-modified MWCNTs dispersions were used for the preparation of waterborne anticorrosive coatings. DPA-modified MWCNTalkyd coatings offers better corrosion protection to steel compared with the surfactant-free coating. The positive effect of DPA on the anticorrosion performance of MWCNT-alkyd coatings was related to its dispersing power on MWCNT and to its corrosion inhibitive properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Relic density of wino-like dark matter in the MSSM								JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS					3					119	10.1007/JHEP03(2016)119			MAR 17 2016	2016	The relic density of TeV-scale wino-like neutralino dark matter in the MSSM is subject to potentially large corrections as a result of the Sommerfeld effect. A recently developed framework enables us to calculate the Sommerfeld-enhanced relic density in general MSSM scenarios, properly treating mixed states and multiple co-annihilating channels as well as including off-diagonal contributions. Using this framework, including on-shell one-loop mass splittings and running couplings and taking into account the latest experimental constraints, we perform a thorough study of the regions of parameter space surrounding the well known pure-wino scenario: namely the effect of sfermion masses being non-decoupled and of allowing non-negligible Higgsino or bino components in the lightest neutralino. We further perform an investigation into the effect of thermal corrections and show that these can safely be neglected. The results reveal a number of phenomenologically interesting but so far unexplored regions where the Sommerfeld effect is sizeable. We find, in particular, that the relic density can agree with experiment for dominantly wino neutralino dark matter with masses ranging from 1.7 to beyond 4 TeV. In light of these results the bounds from Indirect Detection on wino-like dark matter should be revisited.

We investigated the spatial distribution of physical, chemical and biogeochemical parameters in the surface waters of the southern coastal area of Sfax. Pertinent tracers of anthropogenic inputs were identified. Twenty stations were sampled during March 2013 in the vicinity of the coastal areas reserved for waste discharge. Phosphogypsum wastes dumped close to the beaches were the main source of PO43-, Cl- and SO42- in seawater. The high content in total polyphenolic compounds was due to the olive oil treatment waste water released from margins. These inorganic and organic inputs in the surface waters were associated with elevated COD. The BOD5/COD (<0.5) and COD/BOD5 (>3) ratios highlighted a chemical pollution with organic load of a low biodegradability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Four models were compared: the force ellipsoid (FE) and force polytope (FP) based on unit joint torques and the scaled FE (SFE) and scaled FP (SFP) based on maximum isometric joint torques. The four models were assessed from four upper-limb postures with varying elbow flexion (40 degrees, 60 degrees, 80 degrees and 100 degrees) measured by an optoelectronic system and their corresponding isometric joint torques. Ten subjects were recruited. Three specific ellipsoids and polytopes parameters were compared: isotropy, principal force orientation and volume. Isotropy showed that the ellipsoids and polytopes were elongated. The angle between the two ellipsoids main axis and the two polytopes remained low but increased with the elbow flexion. The FE and FP volumes increased and those of SFE and SFP decreased with the elbow flexion. The interest and limits of such models are discussed in the framework of ergonomics and rehabilitation.

The cells were rod-shaped, slightly curved, and motile with peritrichous flagella. The strain was oxidase-negative and catalase-negative. Growth was observed at temperatures ranging from 15 to 45 degrees C (optimum 30 degrees C) and at pH 6.5-9.3 (optimum pH 7.8). The salinity range for growth was 0-3.5 % NaCl (optimum 1 %). Yeast extract was required for growth. Strain Gal1(T) fermented various carbohydrates such as mannose, mannitol, arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, glucose, maltose, sucrose, trehalose and lactose and the major end-products were ethanol and acetate. The only major cellular fatty acid was C16 : 0 (19.6 %). The DNA base G+ C content of strain Gal1(T) was 33.8 mol%. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate indicated that this strain was related to Mobilitalea sibirica DSM 26468(T) with 94.27 % similarity, Clostridium populeti ATTC 35295(T) with 93.94 % similarity, and Clostridium aminovalericum DSM 1283(T) and Anaerosporobacter mobilis DSM 15930(T) with 93.63 % similarity. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and the results of biochemical and physiological tests, strain Gal1(T) was clearly distinguished from closely related genera, and strain Gal1(T) can be assigned to a novel species of a new genus for which the name Mobilisporobacter senegalensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Gal1(T) (5DSM 26537(T) 5JCM 18753(T)).

In this respect, these three Anaerobaculum species should be reclassified within the genus Acetomicrobium, which has priority over the genus Anaerobaculum, which was validated since the genus Acetomicrobium. The DNA G+ C content of Acetomicrobium flavidum is 47.1 mol%, which is of the same order as that of the three Anaerobaculum species. All these bacteria have in common iso-C-15 : 0 as their main fatty acid. Based on further phylogenetic, genetic and chemotaxonomic studies, we propose that Anaerobaculum mobile (=DSM 13181(T) =JCM 12221(T)), Anaerobaculum thermoterrenum (5DSM 13490(T) =5ACM 5076(T)) and Anaerobaculum hydrogeniformans (5DSM 22491(T) 5ATCC BAA-1850(T)) be reclassified as Acetomicrobium mobile comb. nov., Acetomicrobium thermoterrenum comb. nov. and Acetomicrobium hydrogeniformans comb. nov., respectively.

The former is General Relativity, while the latter concerns the second-order conformal structure where one ends up with a BRST algebra handling both the Weyl residual symmetry and diffeomorphisms of spacetime.

This study employs a contingent valuation method to estimate French consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for eco-labeled fresh seafood products. We exploit original data from a survey carried out in 2010, where 626 participants responded to a double-bounded dichotomous choice model, through an ascending or descending bid system. Controlling for shift and anchoring effects in random effect probit models, we significantly improve estimation of WTP and its determinants for the three species studied (monkfish, lobster, sole), in particular when using heterogeneous anchoring. We show that WTP is positively correlated to respondents' income, and also to their environmental concern, to living alone, to living far from the coast, and to trusting NGOs or public institutions more than producer organizations to implement an eco-label. We also show that the mean price premiums do not differ between species. Finally, on average, the maximum premium consumers accepted to pay is approximately 10% of the product price.

Because of geostrophic constraints, this warm and oligotrophic current is forced to flow westward along the continental slope of the Gulf of Lion. But, occasionally, it penetrates on the shelf and strongly impacts the local biogeochemistry and in turn the primary production. By combining in situ observations and high-resolution modelling, it is shown that intrusions on the eastern part of the gulf are mainly forced by easterly or northwesterly wind events, through physical mechanisms that are very different in nature. Easterlies induce a piling of water along the Gulf of Lion coast that drives, through geostrophy, an alongshore shelf-intruding current. This intrusive current occurs independently of the stratification and is concomitant with the wind forcing. On the other hand, intrusions due to northwesterlies only occur during stratified conditions and are related to the development of upwellings along the Gulf of Lion coasts. When the upwelling develops, a northwestward alongshore pressure force balances the Coriolis force associated with the onshore flow at depth. When the winds drop, the upwelling relaxes and the onshore flow weakens. Consequently, the Coriolis force no longer counterbalances the pressure force that ultimately dominates the momentum balance, causing the displacement of the Northern Current on the Gulf of Lion shelf approximately 1 day after the wind relaxation. This time lag between the northwesterlies decrease and the intrusions permits to anticipate possible changes in the biogeochemistry of the Gulf of Lion.

Peripheral and Central Fatigue Development during All-Out Repeated Cycling Sprints								MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE				48	3			391	401		10.1249/MSS.0000000000000800			MAR 2016	2016	Purpose We investigated the development and recovery of peripheral and central fatigue during repeated cycling sprints and its influence on power output. Methods On six separate days, 12 healthy males performed the following tests: 1, 4, 6, 8, and 10 x 10 s sprints with 30 s of passive recovery between sprints, as well as 8 x 10 s sprints with 10 s of passive recovery. Peripheral and central fatigue levels were quantified via changes in preexercise- to postexercise-potentiated quadriceps twitch force, as evoked by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve (30 s through 6 min recovery), and quadriceps voluntary activation (VA), respectively. Root mean square of the vastus lateralis and the vastus medialis electromyogram during sprints were normalized by maximal M wave amplitude (RMS center dot M-max(-1)). Results From the first to the sixth sprint, we found significant and gradual reductions in power output (-25% +/- 7%), RMS center dot M-max(-1) (-7% +/- 4%), twitch force (-47% +/- 11%) and VA (-11% +/- 6%). During the subsequent sprints, no additional reduction in power output, RMS center dot M-max(-1), twitch force or VA, was found. Reduction in between-sprints recovery duration led to a significant reduction in power output and RMS center dot M-max(-1) but no change in peripheral and central fatigue. Conclusion These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that central motor command and power output during all-out repeated sprints are limited in order to prevent excessive locomotor muscle fatigue. They also demonstrate that both the peripheral and central fatigue contribute significantly to the decline in power output elicited via repeated sprints.

Two different samples S1-10 and S2-10 were taken from under the salt crust of Chott El Jerid in the dry season. DGGE analysis revealed that bacterial sequences were related to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, unclassified bacteria, and Deinococcus-Thermus phyla. Anaerobic fermentative and sulfate-reducing bacteria were also detected in this ecosystem. Within the domain archaea, all sequences were affiliated to Euryarchaeota phylum. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of bacteria was 5 x 10(6) DNA copies g(-1) whereas archaea varied between 5 x 10(5) and 10(6) DNA copies g(-1) in these samples. Eight anaerobic halophilic fermentative bacterial strains were isolated and affiliated with the species Halanaerobium alcaliphilum, Halanaerobium saccharolyticum, and Sporohalobacter salinus. These data showed an abundant and diverse microbial community detected in the hypersaline thalassohaline environment of Chott El Jerid.

Here we show that if one starts with a modified Hayward black hole with a time delay in the centre, the algorithm succeeds in producing a rotatingmetric, but curvature divergences reappear. To preserve finiteness, the time delay must be introduced directly at the level of the non-singular rotating metric. This is possible thanks to the deformation of the inner stationarity limit surface caused by the regularisation, and in more than one way. We outline three different possibilities, distinguished by the angular velocity of the event horizon. Along the way, we provide additional results on the Bambi-Modesto rotating Hayward metric, such as the structure of the regularisation occurring at the centre, the behaviour of the quantum gravity scale alike an electric charge in decreasing the angular momentum of the extremal black hole configuration, or details on the deformation of the ergosphere.

The modified particles were characterized by FTIR, TGA, surface charge analysis, and by dielectric constant measurement. The silane molecules were attached to the surface of BaTiO3 particles through Si-O-BaTiO3 bonds. The g-APS grafted on BaTiO3 made the dielectric constant of the particles increase at frequencies >= 0.3 kHz in a wide range of temperature (25 C-o-140 C-o), due to the presence of -NH2 groups. The dependence of the polarization vs. electrical field was measured in order to elucidate the dielectric behavior of the silane treated BaTiO3 in comparison to untreated BaTiO3. The nanocomposite based on epoxy resin containing BaTiO3 nanoparticles untreated and treated with gamma-APS was also prepared and characterized. The results indicated that the gamma-APS-modified BaTiO3 surfaces significantly enhanced the dielectric property of the nanocomposite. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The paper draws upon panel data for Moroccan cities' sizes for this period and uses specific econometric and nonparametric analysis tools in order to show that Morocco's urban system is characterized by convergence. This contrasts with the main goals of regional planning policies in this country, mainly turned toward the regulation of urban concentration, while they should focus on the emergence and the high growth rates of a series of small and medium size cities.

In this work we aimed to analyse the biological activity and potential adverse effects of PM constituents to aquatic organisms. Organic extracts of atmospheric PM samples from different sub-basins of the Mediterranean and Black Seas were screened using different toxicological tests. A yeast-based assay (AhR-RYA) revealed that dioxin-like activity correlated with the concentration of total PAHs in the PM samples, as well as with their predicted toxic equivalent values (TEQs). Although the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (the ZET assay) showed no major phenotypical adverse effects, upregulation of mRNA expression of cyp1a, fos and development-related genes (previously described as related to PM toxicity) was observed in exposed embryos when compared to controls. Results showed that mRNA patterns of the studied genes followed a similar geographic distribution to both PAH content and dioxin-like activity of the corresponding extracts. The analysis also showed a distinct geographical pattern of activation of pancreatic markers previously related to airborne pollution, probably indicating a different subset of uncharacterized particle-bound toxicants. We propose the combination of the bioassays tested in the present study to be applied to future research with autochthonous species to assess exposure and potential toxic effects of ambient PM. Thepresent study emphasizes the need for more in-depth studies into the toxic burden of atmospheric PM on aquatic ecosystems, in order to improve future regulatory guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Cauchy Tetrahedron Argument Applied to Higher Contact Interactions								ARCHIVE FOR RATIONAL MECHANICS AND ANALYSIS				219	3			1305	1341		10.1007/s00205-015-0922-6			MAR 2016	2016	Second gradient theories are nowadays used in many studies in order to describe in detail some transition layers which may occur in micro-structured materials and in which physical properties are sharply varying. Sometimes higher order theories are also evoked. Up to now these models have not been based on a construction of stresses similar to the one due to Cauchy, which has been applied only for simple materials. It has been widely recognized that the fundamental assumption by Cauchy that the traction depends only on the normal of the dividing surface cannot be maintained for higher gradient theories. However, this observation did not urge any author, to our knowledge, to revisit the Cauchy construction in order to adapt it to a more general conceptual framework. This is what we do in this paper for a continuum of grade N (also called N-th gradient continuum). Our construction is very similar to the one due to Cauchy; based on the tetrahedron argument, it does not introduce any argument of a different nature. In particular, we avoid invoking the principle of virtual work. As one should expect, the balance assumption and the regularity hypotheses have to be adapted to the new framework and tensorial computations become more complex.

The treatment of the boundary conditions is done via stochastic finite differences techniques which possess a higher order than the usual methods. The simulation of Brownian paths inside the domain relies on variations around the walk on spheres method with or without killing.

We discuss the conditions under which weaker versions of these notions can be defined, sufficient for statistical mechanics. We focus on reparametrization-invariant systems without additional gauges. The key is to reconstruct statistical mechanics from the ergodic theorem. We find that a suitable split of the system into two non interacting components is sufficient for generalizing statistical mechanics. While equilibrium acquires sense only when the system admits a suitable split into three weakly interacting components-roughly: a clock and two systems among which a generalization of energy is equi-partitioned. This allows the application of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics as an additivity condition of such generalized energy.

In this Rapid Communication, we introduce the intrinsic two-electron coherence of an electronic source in quantum Hall edge channels and relate it to two-electron wave functions and to current noise in a Hanbury Brown-Twiss interferometer. Inspired by the analogy with photon quantum optics, we propose to measure the intrinsic two-electron coherence of a source using low-frequency current correlation measurements at the output of a Franson interferometer. To illustrate this protocol, we discuss how it can distinguish between a time-bin-entangled pure state and a statistical mixture of time-shifted electron pairs.

The effect of different TMS intensities on exercise-induced changes in TMS-elicited variables is unknown, impairing data interpretation. This study aimed to investigate TMS intensity effects on maximal voluntary activation (VATMS), motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and silent periods (SPs) in the quadriceps muscles before, during, and after exhaustive isometric exercise. Eleven subjects performed sets of ten 5-s submaximal isometric quadriceps contractions at 40% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) strength until task failure. Three different TMS intensities (I-100, I-75, I-50) eliciting MEPs of 53 +/- 6%, 38 +/- 5% and 25 +/- 3% of maximal compound action potential (M-max) at 20% MVC were used. MEPs and SPs were assessed at both absolute (40% baseline MVC) and relative (50%, 75%, and 100% MVC) force levels. VATMS was assessed with I-100 and I-75. When measured at absolute force level, MEP/M-max increased during exercise at I-50, decreased at I-100 and remained unchanged at I-75. No TMS intensity effect was observed at relative force levels. At both absolute and relative force levels, SPs increased at I-100 and remained stable at I-75 and I-50. VATMS assessed at I-75 tended to be lower than at I-100. TMS intensity affects exercise-induced changes in MEP/Mmax (only when measured at absolute force level), SPs, and VATMS. These results indicate a single TMS intensity assessing maximal voluntary activation and exercise-induced changes in corticomotoneuronal excitability/inhibition may be inappropriate. (C) 2015 IBRO.

Nanofibers of aniline oligomers were produced using BPA in the aqueous phase while high quality polyaniline nanotubes were produced using DPA in the aqueous phase. PANI nanotubes have a outer diameter 160-240 nm, an inner diameter of 50-100 nm and a length of the order of several mu m. The understanding of the formation of PANI nanotubes was examined by isolation of reaction intermediates and their ex situ characterization by atomic force microscopy. The roles of BPA and DPA on the morphology formation of the PANI nanostructures were discussed. A nanofibrillar template produced by aniline oligomers was found to guide the growth of PANI to nanotubular morphology. PANI nanotubes are thus not derived from DPA vesicles. Preliminary corrosion tests exhibit high corrosion protection efficiency of PANI nanotubes because of their high surface area and corrosion inhibitive properties of DPA dopant.

By assuming that the elasticity tensor of the fiber does not scale with epsilon and that of the matrix scales with epsilon(2), we prove that the one dimensional model is a nonlocal system. We then consider a reference configuration domain filled out by periodically distributed rods similar to those described above. We prove that the homogenized model is a second order nonlocal problem. In particular, we show that the homogenization problem is directly connected to the 3D-1D dimensional reduction problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we show that a simplified, sparse inhibitory network of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons can reproduce some key features of striatal population activity, as observed in brain slices. In particular we develop a new metric to determine the conditions under which sparse inhibitory networks form anti-correlated cell assemblies with time-varying activity of individual cells. We find that under these conditions the network displays an input-specific sequence of cell assembly switching, that effectively discriminates similar inputs. Our results support the proposal that GABAergic connections between striatal projection neurons allow stimulus-selective, temporally-extended sequential activation of cell assemblies. Furthermore, we help to show how altered intrastriatal GABAergic signaling may produce aberrant network-level information processing in disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.

But, in general, this is not the situation for nonlinear codes. In this paper codes over a vector space alphabet are considered. It is proved that if the length of such code is less than some threshold value, then an analogue of the MacWilliams Extension Theorem holds. One family of unextendable code isometrics for the threshold value of code length is described.

The concept is based on an indirect detection of the current generated at the input of the detection chain, through a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) response. In order to improve the correlation between the input current and the oscillator response (signal recognition), the full characterization of the VCO is presented. The solution enhances the particle recognition with a simple analysis of the VCO output. The new output parameter variations are analyzed and the system resolution is explored.

Shewanella frigidimarina has been detected and isolated from marine environments, and in particular, from biofilms. However, its ability to adhere to surfaces and form a biofilm is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the ability to adhere and to form a biofilm of S.frigidimarinaNCIMB400 is significantly higher than that of Shewanella oneidensis in our conditions. We also show that this strain forms a biofilm in artificial seawater, whereas in Luria-Bertani, this capacity is reduced. To identify proteins involved in early biofilm formation, a proteomic analysis of sessile versus planktonic membrane-enriched fractions allowed the identification of several components of the same type VI secretion system gene cluster: putative Hcp1 and ImpB proteins as well as a forkhead-associated domain-containing protein. The upregulation of Hcp1 a marker of active translocation has been confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Our data demonstrated the presence of a single and complete type VI secretion system in S.frigidimarinaNCIMB400 genome, upregulated in sessile compared with planktonic conditions. The fact that three proteins including the secreted protein Hcp1 have been identified may suggest that this type VI secretion system is functional.

The effect of dynamic whole-body vibration warm-up on lower extremity performance								SCIENCE & SPORTS				31	1			19	26		10.1016/j.scispo.2015.11.002			FEB 2016	2016	Objective. Numerous studies have postulated that whole-body vibration (WBV) exercise could be used as a warm-up procedure. Unfortunately, the inconsistency in reporting and standardizing the WBV protocols participate to the lack of consensus of the literature. The purpose of this study was, first, to investigate whether a WBV intervention performed on a vertical synchronous platform could be an effective warm-up procedure. Second, we meticulously paid attention to the quantification of the effective acceleration produced by the platform. Methods. Fourteen recreationally active individuals performed either a WBV (30 Hz/4 mm; theoretical acceleration of 71 m.s(-2)) or non-vibration (NWBV) intervention comprising dynamic squatting exercises intermittently (30 s/30 s) during ten minutes. Pre- and post-intervention tests consisted of countermovement jump, bilateral isometric maximal voluntary contraction of knee extensor muscles and sit and reach box test. Post-tests were performed at one and five minutes after the intervention. Results. Countermovement jump height (+4.92%; P<0.05) and lower extremity flexibility (+13.56%; P<0.001) were significantly increased at five minutes after the WBV intervention whereas no change was observed after the NWBV. Neither WBV nor NWBV intervention improved the bilateral isometric strength of the knee extensor muscles. Importantly, the effective vertical acceleration delivered by the platform was about half the theoretical one (i.e., 34.7 m.s(-2)). Conclusion. In the absence of change after the NWBV intervention, we concluded that our dynamic WBV exercise constitutes a successful warm-up procedure to improve lower extremity performance. The present results also emphasize that the effective acceleration of the WBV devices should be methodically monitored. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.		[Colson, S.

We first describe a new annotated dataset of about 35,000 fish images (MA-35K dataset), derived from the Fish4Knowledge project, covering 10 fish species from the Eastern Indo-Pacific bio-geographic zone. We then resort to a label propagation method able to transfer the labels from the MA-35K to a set of 20 million fish images in order to achieve variability in fish appearance. The resulting annotated dataset, containing over one million annotations (AA-1M), was then manually checked by removing false positives as well as images with occlusions between fish or showing partially fish. Finally, we randomly picked more than 30,000 fish images distributed among ten fish species and extracted from about 400 10-minute videos, and used this data (both images and videos) for the fish task of the LifeCLEF 2014 contest. Together with the fine-grained visual dataset release, we also present two approaches for fish species classification in, respectively, still images and videos. Both approaches showed high performance (for some fish species the precision and recall were close to one) in object classification and outperformed state-of-the-art methods. In addition, despite the fact that dataset is unbalanced in the number of images per species, both methods (especially the one operating on still images) appear to be rather robust against the long-tail curse of data, showing the best performance on the less populated object classes.

The VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) Environmental effects shaping the galaxy stellar mass function								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				586						A23	10.1051/0004-6361/201527129			FEB 2016	2016	We exploit the first public data release of VIPERS to investigate environmental effects in the evolution of galaxies between z similar to 0.5 and 0.9. The large number of spectroscopic redshifts (more than 50 000) over an area of about 10 deg(2) provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. The accurate redshift measurements (sigma(z) = 0.00047(1+ z(spec))) allow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest and highest density environments (delta < 0.7 and delta > 4, respectively) as defined in terms of spatial 3D density contrast delta. We estimate the stellar mass function of galaxies residing in these two environments and constrain the high-mass end (M greater than or similar to 10(11) M-circle dot) with unprecedented precision. We find that the galaxy stellar mass function in the densest regions has a different shape than was measured at low densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter (less negative) slope at z < 0.8. We normalise each mass function to the comoving volume occupied by the corresponding environment and relate estimates from different redshift bins. We observe an evolution of the stellar mass function of VIPERS galaxies in high densities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. We compare these results to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures in the simulated stellar mass functions. We discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellite galaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic and environmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, hence difficult to disentangle. The evolution of our low-density regions is described well by the formalism introduced by Peng et al. (2010, ApJ, 721, 193), and is consistent with the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internal physical processes. The same formalism could also describe the evolution of the mass function in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution from dry mergers is considered.

The dielectric composites properties dependences were studied via a wide range of frequency from 10 Hz to 100 kHz.

First, we study the interplay between Andreev and specular scattering at the interface on the distribution of waiting times of electrons or holes separately. In that case the distribution is not altered dramatically compared to the case of a single quantum channel with a quantum point contact since the interface acts as an Andreev mirror for holes. We then consider a fully entangled state originating from splitting of Cooper pairs at the interface and demonstrate a significant enhancement of the probability to detect two consecutive electrons in a short time interval. Finally, we discuss the electronic waiting time distribution in the more realistic situation of partial entanglement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, the wet phase inversion method was preferred for preparing the hypericin-MIP pearls for several reasons referring to economical benefits but also due to the fact that hypericin "phyto-template" molecules can be generated along with the phase inversion of the copolymer. Practically, the precursor poly(acrylonitrile-co-methacrylic acid) solution was mixed with a purified and concentrated naphtodianthrone phyto-extract (consisting only of hypericin and pseudo-hypericin). In the subsequent phase inversion step hypericin was trapped in the copolymer droplets, as a result to its poor solubility in the inversion water bath, and further served as "phyto-template" in the imprinting step. This in situ repartition of hypericin and pseudo-hypericin was sustained by HPLC-DAD chromatograms which recorded only the presence of hypericin during the extraction stage of imprinted pearls. Batch rebinding measurements, all together, validated the efficiency of this innovative imprinting procedure. The hypericin rebinding of imprinted pearls was quantitative (up to 318 mu g/L) and approximately 5 times more specific relative to the blank pearls. Competitive re-binding revealed a more selective behaviour of imprinted pearls for hypericin when the up-take was measured against pseudohypericin (selectivity coefficient above 4.50).

The main motivation comes from the theory of Kalman filters for continuous-time nonlinear systems with sampled measurements, where this type of equation often arises. Stability is to be understood in the following sense: under appropriate hypotheses, the solution matrix is always symmetric positive definite and bounded from above and below. No uniformity is expected from the sampling procedure, only an upper bound on the elapsed time between consecutive samples is needed. The exposition consists of two parts. First, the stability properties are proven and second, by means of three examples, it is shown how the article's main result applies.

Impurity and defect interactions during laser thermal annealing in Ge								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				119	4					045702	10.1063/1.4940737			JAN 28 2016	2016	The microscopic mechanisms involving dopants, contaminants, and defects in Ge during pulsed melting laser thermal annealing (LTA) are investigated in detail. Samples both un-implanted and implanted with As or B are processed by LTA as well as characterized in terms of chemical (1D and 3D), electrical, and strain profiling. The clustering of As is directly measured by 3D chemical profiling and correlated with its partial electrical activation along with a reduction of the lattice strain induced by As atoms. A semi-quantitative microscopic model involving the interaction with mobile As-vacancy (AsV) complexes is proposed to describe the clustering mechanism. Boron is shown to follow different clustering behavior that changes with depth and marked by completely different strain levels. Oxygen penetrates from the surface into all the samples as a result of LTA and, only in un-implanted Ge, it occupies an interstitial position inducing also positive strain in the lattice. On the contrary, data suggest that the presence of As or B forces O to assume different configurations with negligible strain, through O-V or O-B interactions for the two dopant species, respectively. These data suggest that LTA does not inject a significant amount of vacancies in Ge, at variance with Si, unless As atoms or possibly other n-type dopants are present. These results have to be carefully considered for modeling the LTA process in Ge and its implementation in technology. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

A high resolution and quasi-zonal transect of dissolved Ba in the Mediterranean Sea								MARINE CHEMISTRY				178				1	7		10.1016/j.marchem.2015.12.001			JAN 20 2016	2016	The dissolved barium (D_Ba) data set for the Mediterranean Sea is here expanded with data from a large-scale transect sampled in April 2011 (M84/3 cruise) at high resolution. A total of 833 seawater samples have been analyzed for D_Ba. Over the basin the D_Ba content ranges from 38 to 85 nmol kg(-1) with local deep D_Ba maxima reaching up to 172 nmol kg(-1). Deep D_Ba maxima are associated with near bottom waters influenced by benthic processes and brine waters. The water column is largely undersaturated with respect to barite (BaSO4, the main phase of particulate biogenic barium P_Ba), with water column barite saturation state ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 over the basin. This new D_Ba dataset shows that the general zonal distribution of D_Ba is impacted by the large-scale Mediterranean circulation, as evidenced by the Levantine Intermediate Water zonal and meridional progression as well as by the eastward flow of surface Atlantic Water. However biogeochemical processes are also at play, as suggested by an elevated D_Ba content of deep waters and by local lower D_Ba contents in intermediate waters. These features could be attributed to active cycling between the particulate and dissolved Ba phases. Since P_Ba barite has been recognized in previous studies as a proxy for particulate organic carbon remineralization at intermediate depths, the significance of local changes in the water column D_Ba patterns may be the key to better constrain the Ba and carbon dynamics in the Mediterranean Sea.

The gyre experiences a weak net buoyancy gain that arises from a leading-order cancelation between two opposing contributions, linked to two cells of water mass transformation and diapycnal overturning. The lower cell involves a cooling-driven densification of 8.42.0Sv of Circumpolar Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water near the gyre's southern and western margins. The upper cell entails a freshening-driven conversion of 4.92.0Sv of Circumpolar Deep Water into lighter upper ocean waters within the gyre interior. The distinct role of salinity between the two cells stems from opposing salinity changes induced by sea ice production, meteoric sources, and admixture of fresh upper ocean waters in the lower cell, which contrasts with coherent reductions in salinity associated with sea ice melting and meteoric sources in the upper cell.

To recover various information on unknown components in chemical mixtures, multilinear tensor decomposition of multiway fluorescence spectra has proven extremely powerful. However, inner filter effects induce a systematic error on measurements, disturbing the decomposition. In this paper, we fully describe a non multilinear approach to include inner filter effects in the model instead of neglecting them or correcting them by linearization methods. A theoretical framework on non multilinear tensor decomposition is developed, an algorithm to recover the factors in the decomposition is detailed, and real data computer results are reported.

It consists in applying rotation invariant local binary pattern operators (LBPriu2) to a series of moment images, defined by local statistics uniformly computed using a given spatial support. It can be seen as a generalisation of the commonly used complementation approach (CLBP), since it extends the local description not only to local contrast information, but also to higher order local variations. In short, SBPs aim at expanding LBP self-similarity operator from the local grey level to the regional distribution level. Thanks to a richer local description, the SBPs have better discrimination power than other LBP variants. Furthermore, thanks to the regularisation effect of the statistical moments, the SBP descriptors show better noise robustness than classical CLBPs. The interest of the approach is validated through a large experimental study performed on five texture databases: KTH-TIPS, KTH-TIPS 2b, CUReT, UIUC and DTD. The results show that, for the four first datasets, the SBPs are comparable or outperform the recent state-of-the-art methods, even using small support for the LBP operator, and using limited size spatial support for the computation of the local statistics.

Allelopathic interactions between the brown algal genus Lobophora (Dictyotales, Phaeophyceae) and scleractinian corals								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						18637	10.1038/srep18637			JAN 5 2016	2016	Allelopathy has been recently suggested as a mechanism by which macroalgae may outcompete corals in damaged reefs. Members of the brown algal genus Lobophora are commonly observed in close contact with scleractinian corals and have been considered responsible for negative effects of macroalgae to scleractinian corals. Recent field assays have suggested the potential role of chemical mediators in this interaction. We performed in situ bioassays testing the allelopathy of crude extracts and isolated compounds of several Lobophora species, naturally associated or not with corals, against four corals in New Caledonia. Our results showed that, regardless of their natural association with corals, organic extracts from species of the genus Lobophora are intrinsically capable of bleaching some coral species upon direct contact. Additionally, three new C-21 polyunsaturated alcohols named lobophorenols A-C (1-3) were isolated and identified. Significant all elopathic effects against Acropora muricata were identified for these compounds. In situ observations in New Caledonia, however, indicated that while allelopathic interactions are likely to occur at the macroalgal-coral interface, Lobophora spp. rarely bleached their coral hosts. These findings are important toward our understanding of the importance of allelopathy versus other processes such as herbivory in the interaction between macroalgae and corals in reef ecosystems.

J	Xuan Son Nguyen; Thanh Phuong Nguyen; Charpillet, Francois			IEEE					Effective Surface Normals Based Action Recognition in Depth Images								International Conference on Pattern Recognition								817	822					2016	2016	In this paper, we propose a new local descriptor for action recognition in depth images. The proposed descriptor relies on surface normals in 4D space of depth, time, spatial coordinates and higher-order partial derivatives of depth values along spatial coordinates. In order to classify actions, we follow the traditional Bag-of-words (BoW) approach, and propose two encoding methods termed Multi-Scale Fisher Vector (MSFV) and Temporal Sparse Coding based Fisher Vector Coding (TSCFVC) to form global representations of depth sequences. The highdimensional action descriptors resulted from the two encoding methods are fed to a linear SVM for efficient action classification. Our proposed methods are evaluated on two public benchmark datasets, MSRAction3D and MSRGesture3D. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods on both the datasets.

First, it demonstrates that this notion, more than any other conceptual tool, can cover all of the trends common to postmodernist corpus and details five axes (generic hybridity, dialogical hybridity, hybridity of time and space, hybridity of the characters, and identitarian hybridity). Then, it looks at the figure of the cyborg and its presence in contemporary Latin American literature. If now the concept of hybridity remains operative to analyse post-humanist works, it may also seems somewhat narrow to explain these new post-humanist phenomena.

Yet at the same time the harmonious balance between the selected texts and the iconographic program tends to weaken the religious and ideological agenda suggested by the Crusades. The result is a more diffuse emphasis upon the defamiliarization associated with exotic travel. Among other things, the images magnify the sea and the rivers, symbolizing a frontier with 'otherness' and a passage to the wonders of the East.

Recently, some works have shown the interest of these tractable classes from a different viewpoint. For example, it is known that if there is no broken triangle on each two values of a given variable in an arc-consistent binary CSP, then this variable can be eliminated without changing its satisfiability. Next, it has been proved that even when this rule cannot be applied, it may be the case that for a given pair of values no broken triangle occurs, if this is the case, then we can perform a domain-reduction operation which consists in merging these values while preserving satisfiability. In this paper, we show that partial or total presence of tractable properties in non-binary constraints is sufficient for them to be decomposable into a set of lower arity constraints while preserving equivalence. More precisely, we prove that the presence of bijection or Dual Broken Triangle Property in non-binary constraint permits to decompose it while preserving equivalence.

This problem can be addressed by exact methods, but more classically it is solved by approximate methods. Here, we focus primarily on the exact counting. We show how it is possible to improve the methods based on structural decomposition by offering to enhance the search for a new solution which is a critical step for counting, particularly for such methods. Moreover, if the resources in time or in space are insufficient, we show that our approach is still able to provide a lower bound of the result. Experiments on CSP benchmarks show the practical advantage of our approach w.r.t. the best methods of the literature.

However, on structured instances (particularly on the ones issued from industrial applications), they are significantly outperformed by other types of Max-SAT solvers. In the SAT context, CDLC solvers perform very well on industrial instances. One of the main reasons of this efficiency is the learning mechanism of nogood clauses, which has been introduced more than fifteen years ago. It allows solvers to learn from their failure with a twofold objective: limit redundancies and lead the exploration to the most promising areas of the search space. We propose in this paper a similar mechanism, which we call nobetter clause learning, adapted to BnB Max-SAT solvers. The results we have obtained show gains on industrial instances. These results call for more work in this direction, to further improve the quality of the information learned and make a better exploitation of them.

Growth is thus determined by the distribution of such signal. Meanwhile, the diffusion of the signal is itself affected by the changes in shape and size of the organism. In other words, there is a complete coupling between the diffusion of the signal and the change of the shapes. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model to investigate such coupling. The shape is given by a manifold, that varies in time as the result of a deformation given by a transport equation. The signal is represented by a density, diffusing on the manifold via a diffusion equation. We show the non-commutativity of the transport and diffusion evolution by introducing a new concept of Lie bracket between the diffusion and the transport operator. We also provide numerical simulations showing this phenomenon.

This paper consider the cycle optimization problem for a deterministic timed weighted marked graphs under infinite server semantics. The problem aims to find an initial marking to minimize the cycle time while the weighted sum of tokens in places is less than or equal to a desired value.

Meanwhile, two suboptimal methods are proposed to reduce the computational cost.

In more detail, a set of sites observe the system evolution, each one with its own observation mask. Sites do not exchange information with each other but communicate with a coordinator. The coordinator is able to detect a fault if and only if at least one site is able to do that. The proposed approach is based on a necessary and sufficient condition for codiagnosability, namely the absence of sequences that are "ambiguous" with respect to all sites and whose length may grow indefinitely after the occurrence of some fault (i.e., sequences of infinite length that could be observed either in the presence of a fault and with no fault). The novelties of the approach consist in using the notion of basis markings to avoid exhaustive enumeration of the set of reachable markings, and in the construction of an automaton, called Verifier, that enables to detect the presence of ambiguous sequences.

We generalize the Jurdjevic-Quinn control strategy to such mean-field equations to achieve stability in a suitable sense. For instance, in the context of crowds, consensus or alignment of agents are among the most relevant goals and they correspond to stability to a suitable manifold. Our main result is the definition of a Jurdjevic-Quinn strategy that is sparse, i.e. that acts on a small set of the configuration space at each time. We show that such a stabilization strategy can be adapted to achieve alignment of the kinetic Cucker-Smale model with a sparse control only.

This paper shows methodology to measure VPD, by using fuzzy modeling type Takagi-Sugeno (T-S). Fuzzy modeling is based on expert and human knowledge, additionally this is combined with mathematical techniques to identify parameters of the antecedents and consequents of IF-THEN fuzzy rules, each IF-THEN fuzzy rule defines a submodel or region of interpolation. In this work, expert knowledge is the information described in psychrometric chart. Modeling learning was performed using air temperature and relative humidity, a set of 8 fuzzy rules was proposed to interpolate the VPD. The results of the fuzzy model are illustrated using measurements of an experimental I greenhouse, and was contrasted with a model well known in the literature. The algorithm of fuzzy modelling VPD, was codified in two platform application real time: C to microcontroller and LabVIEW (TM) thus it is possible measuring the instantaneous VPD.

In this paper, a sub class of time Petri net named timed weighted marked graphs (TWMGs) are studied. Stationary throughput analysis of these TWMGs is an important step for checking throughput requirements of concurrent real-time applications and finding the best schedules.

However, the conventional algorithms use exclusively rule-based models and features vector to classify whether a frame is fire or not. These features are difficult to define and depend largely on the kind of fire observed. The outcome leads to low detection rate and high false-alarm rate. A different approach for this problem is to use a learning algorithm to extract the useful features instead of using an expert to build them. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying fire in videos. Convolutional neural network are shown to perform very well in the area of object classification. This network has the ability to perform feature extraction and classification within the same architecture. Tested on real video sequences, the proposed approach achieves better classification performance as some of relevant conventional video fire detection methods and indicates that using CNN to detect fire in videos is very promising.

A method to detect them consists in tracking the heartbeat rate from ECG signal. In this case, QRS complexes have to be localized and it is proposed here to use an energy detector to enable this. It can be integrated in an analog circuit and can also address low power and low cost applications such as consumer embedded electronics. Using a 0.35 m CMOS technology from AMS, the design of the analog multiplier cell required by the energy detector is presented here. It shows a voltage gain upper than 18 with a sufficient linearity for the targeted applications. Preliminary results of the full energy detector which mix Matlab computations and Eldo post-layout simulations show a detection rate about 98.8% for SNR upper than 0 dB.

In order to carry out such applications in other frequency domains, the instantaneous frequency of the impulse signal is commonly used. This paper describes the design of an Instantaneous Frequency Measurement system in order to show its feasibility for Ultra-WideBand impulse radio radar and imaging applications. The integrated part of the system is constituted of a full-wave rectifier, a delay cell and an analog multiplier. These devices were designed in CMOS 130 nm technology and consumes 95.6 mW for a supply voltage of 1.2V.

This does not mean that the impact of public policies on the pace and pattern of growth should be taken for granted. Thus, it is necessary to dissociate the type of growth from the type of inclusion in order to frame the relevant public policies to achieve inclusion. This requires performing sophisticated targeting of the poor and vulnerable and assessing the actual conditions under which sectoral policies such as health policy are implemented. The reform of Morocco's health system with the extension of medical coverage targeting the poorest (RAMED) provides an instructive illustration of the arduous challenges that government faces to frame inclusive public policies. Ensuring the right to health to a wider number of Moroccan citizens requires having a more comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach to health.

The model computes the social attitude of a virtual agent given its social role during the interaction and its social relation toward the interactant. The resulting attitude influences the agent's social goals and therefore determines the decisions made by the agent in terms of actions and communicative intentions to accomplish. We conducted an empirical study in the context of virtual tutor-child interaction where participants evaluated the tutor's perceived social attitude towards the child while the tutor's social role and relation were manipulated by our model. Results showed that both role and social relation have an influence on the agent's perceived social attitude.

All data has been acquired with the same instrumentation and representative size distributions for marine air masses at 10 m/s wind speed have been selected for comparison. Differences in the concentrations of larger and smaller aerosols at the various sites are explained in terms of fetch, trade winds, shielding, pollution, seawater temperature and phytoplankton bloom. The differences in size distribution induce significant differences in the extinction coefficients from the VIS to the LWIR at the various sites. Consequently, the transmission over a specific range also varies significantly. This suggests that a detailed analysis of the conditions at each site is necessary in order to understand the exact aerosol behavior and to correctly predict electro-optical propagation effects due to aerosols.

This "serialization" of the narrative imagination, as well as of the criteria presiding over its critical analysis and its aesthetic appreciation is a result of the influence exercised by the symbolism of consumer goods on traditional symbolic practices. The purpose of this article is to show that the idea of literature, music, painting or, more generally, of art, which serves as a reference to all the critical and aesthetic metalanguages of postmodernity is only an ideological attempt to legitimate the forms through which the symbolic ascendancy of consumer goods displays its power on the behavior and the thought pattern of contemporary Western society.

The limited screen size makes current mobile devices quite hard to visualize multifaceted web pages, so this kind of content could be adjusted to meet the device needs. CMS-based websites, in general, are designed for large screens and when users go online with mobile phones, smartphones and tablets they feel some discomfort. The usability and user experience may be reduced when interacting with learning platforms that are not optimized for such features. A possible solution has arisen with recent advances in Responsive Web Design specifications. This adaptive web design technique advocates a single self-adaptive interface and avoids thereby multiplication of information sources and technical supports and promotes the possibility to design adaptive e-Learning courses and adaptive e-Learning mobile applications. In this paper we discuss about the possibilities of Responsive Web Design technique to adapt a learning content compared to an adaptive service-based approach to design responsive learning contents for m-Learning usage.

Our proposed descriptor jointly encodes the shape and motion cues using surface normals in 4D space of depth, time, spatial coordinates and higher-order partial derivatives of depth values along spatial coordinates. In a traditional Bag-of-words (BoW) approach, local descriptors extracted from a depth sequence are encoded to form a global representation of the sequence. In our approach, local descriptors are encoded using Sparse Coding (SC) and Fisher Vector (FV), which have been recently proven effective for action recognition. Action recognition is then simply performed using a linear SVM classifier. Our proposed action descriptor is evaluated on two public benchmark datasets, MSRAction3D and MSRGesture3D. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed method on both the datasets.

Despite increasingly large datasets, this detection is often manual or semi-automatic, requiring manual tuning/postprocessing. We review the state of the art in automatic bird sound detection, and identify a widespread need for tuning-free and species-agnostic approaches.

Often four resistive elements are connected together in a Wheatstone bridge to provide electrical variations of sensors. When this structure is biased with a fixed voltage source or a current source the topology provides a differential output voltage. To exploit information a conditioning circuit is associated to the bridge. In most cases it consists of an instrumentation amplifier followed by a data converter to obtain very quickly a digital representation of information. Due to the high input impedance of the instrumentation amplifier, bridge sensitivity is preserved. A filter may be added to avoid aliasing or a continuous time sigma-delta modulator that includes filtering feature. This study is concerning the conditioning structure for piezoresistive sensors bridge especially fully integrated microphones for biomedical application. The bridge signal to noise ratio is set by biasing the amplifier stage by current. The noise performance becomes the limiting factor of the read-out circuit. Current mode topologies drive amplifiers design where inputs are the main noise contributor. Modeling noise contribution is a key point in the design of the conditioning circuit. The current consumption leads noise performances too. A proposed architecture was implemented in a 65nm CMOS standard technology for performance measurement and evaluation with nanowire based microphone dedicated to hearing aids application.

We generalize the framework of Gerard, Sjostrand (1987), in the sense that we allow for both hyperbolic and elliptic eigenvalues of Poincare map, and show that all resonances in W = [E-o - epsilon(o), E-o + epsilon(o)] - i]0, h(delta)], 0 < delta < 1, are given by a generalized Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule (BS).

The observer system is composed of a transmitter (emitting continuously, said also in high duty cycle mode) and a set of passive underwater acoustic sensors (e.g. receiving sonobuoys) not necessarily collocated with the transmitter. Each receiver detects the single-tone signal emitted by the transmitter after its reflection on the target. The two sets of doubly Doppler-shifted frequency measurements for each receiver make the target motion analysis (TMA) feasible, even when only one receiver is available. First, we develop the exact model of the bistatic received frequencies and then we compute the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) when the number of receivers is 1, 2, or 3, the measurements being corrupted by an additive and time-independent Gaussian noise. Finally, using some realistic scenarios, we show that the maximum likelihood estimated is actually efficient.

J	Pereira, O. J. R.; Montes, C. R.; Lucas, Y.; Melfi, A. J.								Evaluation of Pedotransfer Equations to Predict Deep Soil Carbon Stock in Tropical Podzols Compared to Other Soils of the Brazilian Amazon Forest								Progress in Soil Science								331	349		10.1007/978-3-319-28295-4_21			2016	2016	According to the soil measurement procedures proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the sampling depth for SOC stock estimation is centred on the upper soil horizons where root biomass and organic matter inputs are concentrated, depending on soil type and ecosystem, typically between 0 and 0.3 m. However, recent research in areas of Amazonian Podzols has shown that these soils store a great amount of carbon in thick spodic horizons (Bh). The amount of carbon stored in deep Bh horizons of Podzols (down to 3 m) may exceed 80 kg C m(-2) in some regions of the Amazon. Thus, a better understanding of the vertical distribution of the SOC in Amazonian soils is an urgent matter considering the volume of carbon stored in Podzols, in a context of global climate change. Given this, the main goal of this research was to test and to propose pedotransfer functions based on several Amazonian soil profiles in order to estimate SOC stock and evaluate different soil attributes that could be used to infer indirectly, soil bulk density. For this propose, we selected around 320 pedons that were collected in the region of the Rio Negro Basin, to model the vertical distribution of SOC stock using a series of negative exponential profile depth functions and parametric/nonparametric functions for Podzols. The derived function parameters were used to predict carbon stock in deep horizons for all studied profiles and to explain the vertical behaviour of the SOC stock in Podzol profiles. The soil bulk density of Amazonian soils was properly modelled by symbolic regression, considering pH, clay content and SOC as the most relevant variables likely to affect soil bulk density values. We observed that the SOC stored in deep horizons of non-podzolic soils can be modelled by exponential decay equations. However, in Podzol, the vertical distribution of carbon stock is highly complex with a significant increase in deep horizons, which cannot be explained by negative exponential functions. Our findings have shown that the SOC stock of Amazonian soils, excluding Podzols, can be predicted by fitted exponential functions (RMSE: 0.9 kg Cm-2). However, the vertical variation of SOC stored in Podzol profiles can be modelled just by complex equations (equal-area spline RMSE: 13.6 kg Cm-2; Fourier RMSE 15.9 kg C m(-2) and Sum of Sines RMSE: 15.0 kg C m(-2)) with a large number of parameters. According to the results achieved in this research, we concluded that the SOC stock of Podzols can be indirectly estimated for the whole soil profile by integrating the Sum of Sines and Fourier equations, which is not possible when applying an equal-area spline fitting due to the absence of model parameters. Moreover, spodic horizons store most of the carbon pool of podzolic regions and the Podzols have more than twice of the capability of storing carbon when compared to other Amazonian soils.

Moreover, two different algorithms to calculate non-symmetric SMDs are presented as examples, the TEDIA (TEnsor DIAgonalization) algorithm and the IDIEM-NS (Improved DIagonalization using Equivalent Matrices- Non Symmetric) algorithm. The SECSI-TEDIA framework has an increased computational complexity but often achieves a better performance than the original SECSI framework.

All the current robots are based on a humanoid model, which is not the unique one in Nature. In this paper we compare the natural bipedies in order to explore new tracks to improve robotic bipedal locomotion. This study starts with a short review of the historical bases of the biological bipedies to explain the differences between the structures of the human and bird bodies. The observations on the kinematics of bird walking describe a modular system that can be reproduced in robotics to take advantage of the bird leg versatility. For comparison purposes, a bird model is scaled up to have the same mass and the same height of the center of mass as a humanoid model. Simulation results show that the bird model can execute larger strides and stay on course, compared with the humanoid model. In addition the results confirm the functional decomposition of the bird system into the trunk and the thighs for the one part, and the distal part of the leg for the other part.

Specifically, for a given variable in a binary arc-consistent CSP, if no broken triangle occurs on any pair of values, then this variable can be eliminated while preserving satisfiability. More recently, it has been shown that even when this rule cannot be applied, it could be possible that for a given pair of values no broken triangle occurs. In this case, we can apply a domain-reduction operation which consists in merging these values while preserving satisfiability. In this paper we show that under certain conditions, and even if there are some broken triangles on a pair of values, these values can be merged without changing the satisfiability of the instance. This allows us to define a stronger merging operation and a new tractable class of binary CSP instances. We report experimental trials on benchmark instances.

IEEE					Design of Pulse Synthesizers for the Convergence of IR-UWB Solutions								IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference														2016	2016	This paper presents some techniques to synthesize pulses in the context of IR-UWB. Pulse synthesizers are good candidates when different kinds of pulses are needed to comply with different standards or when the shape of the pulses needs to be modified. Two different approaches are described here. Voltage Controlled Delay Line (VCDL) based pulses are first described. For this family, two kinds of combiners are presented: differential pairs based and H-bridge based. The second one achieves a larger output dynamic but is limited by the use of the VCDL. A second type of H-bridge based synthesizer using VCO is presented. Using both a VCO and a H-Bridge offers the largest synthesis capabilities since it allows large voltage pulses to be synthesized and the pulse duration is not limited. All proposed architectures have been implemented and their measured performances are given for comparison.

The stability analysis is performed in three steps. We have demonstrated the usage of the method for a specific case, but the idea can be extended to more general problems. In particular, the method can be extended to the case of systems over the homogeneous space X of a compact Lie group G that comes from the action of G. Such systems are called compact Killing systems. A more involved generalization can be considered, in the general case of bilinear systems over R-n.

Following the 3D low Mach compressible Euler model developed in [14] and previous works from [20], [11] and [13], we are now interested in simulating the motion of a floating structure in an air-water flow. In the context of a fictitious domain, a volumic penalization is applied inside the body to ensure a rigidity constraint through a penalized velocity in order to get the correct motion of the rigid body. The tracking of the solid is insured by the reconstruction of a Heaviside function thanks to a ray-casting algorithm. The validity of our fluid-structure interaction (FSI) procedure is investigated through some examples.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE WAKE STRUCTURE BEHIND THREE-DIMENSIONAL HILL UNDER STABLE STRATIFICATION								Topical Problems of Fluid Mechanics								17	22					2016	2016	This paper is aimed to demonstrate the increase in complexity of wall bounded flow around a three-dimensional hill while the stable stratification is introduced. The high-resolution numerical simulations allow for detailed visualizations of various flow features that are characteristic for this type of flows and are virtually absent in the classical neutral case. The flow over a single 3D hill was chosen as a typical scenario found in atmospheric boundary layer flows, being of crucial importance in predicting many important phenomena including e.g. local precipitations or pollution dispersion. The governing equations of fluid motion are based on the Boussinesq approximation of momentum equations, supplemented by the divergence-free incompressibility constraint. These equations are solved numerically using high-order compact finite-difference scheme on non-orthogonal, wall-fitted grid. Selected numerical results are discussed in detail to demonstrate some of the most notable flow features.

The first part is devoted to the presentation of a modified boundary condition to take into account the fact that physical walls are approached by the mesh. A second part deals with the algorithm to solve bifluid Navier-Stokes equations. Then, bifluid flows with surface tension are considered and some applications follow.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF GRASSLAND-FIRES BEHAVIOR USING FIRESTAR3D MODEL								Topical Problems of Fluid Mechanics								129	140					2016	2016	This study reports 3D numerical simulations of the ignition and the propagation of grassland fires. The mathematical model consists in solving the conservation equations governing the behavior of the coupled system formed by the vegetation and the ambient atmosphere. Based on a finite volume discretization, the computation code is parallelized using OpenMP directives and had been the subject of numerous validations. The model was previously tested on small scale in case of homogeneous litter fires; in this study it is proposed to test it on larger scale in case of grassland fires. The results are in fairly good agreement with experimental data, with predictions of operational empirical-models developed in Australia (MK5) and in the USA (BEHAVE), as well as with and predictions of physical models (FIRETEC, WFDS, FireStar2D). The comparison with the literature is based on the estimation of the rate of fire spread (ROS) and the analysis of the fire-front shape.

Bioenergetics, Trophic Ecology, and Niche Separation of Tunas								Advances in Marine Biology				74				199	344		10.1016/bs.amb.2016.06.002			2016	2016	Tunas are highly specialized predators that have evolved numerous adaptations for a lifestyle that requires large amounts of energy consumption. Here we review our understanding of the bioenergetics and feeding dynamics of tunas on a global scale, with an emphasis on yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack, albacore, and Atlantic bluefin tunas. Food consumption balances bioenergetics expenditures for respiration, growth (including gonad production), specific dynamic action, egestion, and excretion. Tunas feed across the micronekton and some large zooplankton. Some tunas appear to time their life history to take advantage of ephemeral aggregations of crustacean, fish, and molluscan prey. Ontogenetic and spatial diet differences are substantial, and significant interdecadal changes in prey composition have been observed. Diet shifts from larger to smaller prey taxa highlight ecosystem-wide changes in prey availability and diversity and provide implications for changing bioenergetics requirements into the future. Where tunas overlap, we show evidence of niche separation between them; resources are divided largely by differences in diet percentages and size ranges of prey taxa. The lack of long-term data limits the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tuna feeding behaviour. We note the need for systematic collection of feeding data as part of routine monitoring of these species, and we highlight the advantages of using biochemical techniques for broad-scale analyses of trophic relations. We support the continued development of ecosystem models, which all too often lack the regional-specific trophic data needed to adequately investigate climate and fishing impacts.		[Olson, R.

ESTUDOS DE RELIGIAO				30	1			75	91					JAN-APR 2016	2016	For almost ten years, we have seen churches in the United States caution against growing "threats to religious freedom". These threats include, among other, the provision of contraception services under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the legalization of gay marriage in 2015. Such rhetoric appears to be a ploy to reinvigorate the fight against abortion, contraception and gay marriage through making a more compelling case than calling directly for restrictions on reproductive freedom and gay rights. The campaign seems to be already bearing fruits, as it has led to a rapprochement of hitherto distant Catholic and Evangelical churches, while the redefinition of religious liberty as formulated by these religious groups has had a significant influence on the judicial and legislative debates.

Cryptographic post-quantum algorithms have been proposed since 1970s. However, side-channel attack vulnerabilities of these algorithms are still in focus of the recent research. In this paper, we present a differential power analysis attack on the McEliece public-key cryptosystem. We demonstrate that a part of a private key, permutation matrix, can be recovered using the power analysis. We attack a software implementation of a secure bit permutation that was proposed by Strenzke et al. at PQCrypto 2008. The cryptosystem is implemented on a 32-bit ARM based microcontroller. We provide details of the attack and results using power consumption measurements of the device. In addition, we outline a novel countermeasure against the introduced attack. The countermeasure uses properties of the linear codes and does not require large amount of random bits which can be profitable for low-cost embedded devices.

A system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder, who only has partial observations on the system's evolution, is never able to infer that the current state of the system is within a set of secret states. In this work, we address the problem of enforcing current-state opacity by supervisory control. Given a system that is modeled with a finite automaton and that is not current-state opaque with respect to a given secret, the enforcement problem consists in designing a supervisor so that the controlled system is current-state opaque. We assume that the supervisor can only observe and control a subset of events. To be more general, we assume no specific containment relationship exists between the sets of events that can be observed by the intruder and the supervisor, respectively. We call this general setting uncomparable observations. We show that the maximally permissive supervisor always exists and propose a novel approach for its design.

Indeed, in these ultimate absorbers electron-phonon scattering are reduced and thickness can be lower than the electron mean-free-path. In this case carriers reach contact ballistically. However it is important that the contact permits to extract these carriers. This theoretical study is about the extraction of the photogenerated carriers and particularly the ballistic extraction without any scattering. We show that quantum interaction between the ultra-thin absorber and the contact can be used to enhance the extraction. Particularly, a contact composed of a quantum well into a double barrier permits to increase the current compared to a simple contact. This improvement is due to a quantum resonance. This result is interesting for the hot carrier solar cells but also for all the ultra-thin cells.

We rely on the nonequilibrium Green's function methodology to provide a framework which combines optoelectronics and thermodynamics in a unified picture of energy conversion for nanoscaled optoelectronics. Indeed, we follow the self-consistent Born approximation to derive the formal expressions of energy and entropy currents flowing inside a nanodevice only interacting with light. These expressions are numerically evaluated in a quantum-dot based nanodevice, where verification of the second law of thermodynamics raises questioning about the system model.

The goal of this work is to create a labelled spatial map of substrate types from ROV video in order to support biological and geological domain research. The output of our method describes the mixtures of geological features such as sediment and types of lava flow in images taken at a set of points chosen from an ROV dive. The main contribution of this work is the assembly of a pipeline combining several unique approaches which is able to robustly generate substrate type mixtures under the varying lighting and perspective conditions of deep-sea ROV dive videos. The pipeline comprises three main components: sampling, in which a trained classifier and spatial sampling is used to select relevant frames from the dataset; feature extraction, in which the improved local binary pattern descriptor (ILBP) is used to generate a Bag of Words (BoW) representation of the dataset; and topic modelling in which a variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is used to infer the mixture of substrate types represented by each BoW. Our method significantly outperforms techniques relying on keypoint based features rather than texture based features, and k-means rather than LDA, demonstrating that our proposed pipeline accurately learns and identifies visible substrate types.

Hierarchical design and control of NaCe(WO4)(2) crystals: structural and optical properties								CRYSTENGCOMM				18	35			6579	6593		10.1039/c6ce01340f			2016	2016	Double rare earth tungstates NaCe(WO4)(2) have been successfully synthesized hydrothermally for the first time with cerium as the trivalent cation in the tetragonal single phase. The resulting hierarchical superstructures were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction in conjunction with Rietveld refinements and Raman spectroscopy. Their shape and size were observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was found that morphology modulation could be realized by controlling the amount of EDTA ligand (0.3-0.35 g) and the pH values (6-8) of the system solution. Hierarchical microstructures resulted firstly from the coalescence of nanosheets and secondly from the self-assembly of nanoplatelets, nanorods and nanosheets, giving rise to sphere, flower and novel spindle morphologies, respectively. Structural determinations showed that the crystal structure belongs to the scheelite family ABWO(4), with Na and Ce atoms occupying the same sites. Refinement calculations revealed that the microstructures showed different distortions of the polyhedral structure according to the W-O and Ce(Na)-O bonds and angles splitting. The formation mechanisms of the resulting hierarchical architectures are put forward based on a series of time-dependent experiments. Furthermore, the optical properties of the microstructures were strongly related to their morphologies, crystallite size and polyhedral distortion.		[Dirany, N.; Arab, M.; Valmalette, J.

J	Trojette, Ines								THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH: THE INSTITUTIONAL THRESHOLD								REGION ET DEVELOPPEMENT					43			111	138					2016	2016	This paper examines whether the effect of foreign direct investment on economic growth is dependent upon the institutional level for five regions (SSA, MENA, Europe, Asia and America). Using GMM system covering the period from 1984-2013, our results highlight the role of institutional development in moderating the ambiguous impacts of FDI on GDP growth. Under the threshold regression, technique developed by Caner and Hansen (2004) we find that the index of institutions matter for all groups except for the America group. The fact of taking the components of institutions reveal that above the threshold of government stability and the respect of law and order FDI enhances GDP growth.

The resulting nanostructures were characterized using X-ray diffraction combined with Rietveld refinements, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopies. Their morphologies and sizes were analyzed by scanning and electron microscopies. The electrical, optical, catalytic and photocatalytic properties of the NP-WO3 nanoplatelets were then determined and compared to the ones of pseudospherical (PS-WO3) standard samples. Nanoplatelets as well as pseudospherical particles crystallized in the single orthorhombic WO3 phase. The Rietveld refinement calculations and HRTEM analyses revealed a strong distortion of the WO6 octahedra, according to the W-O splitting. The electrical conductivity of WO3 compact pellets showed that both samples were semi-conducting with a weak difference in activation energies. Using a homemade photocatalytic device, the NP-WO3 particles used as photocatalyst in an aqueous medium, exhibited a significant efficiency to decompose rhodamine B over their large exposed surface (010), compared to PS-WO3 particles. These NP-WO3 particles were also used as the catalytic material for oxidation in an air-CO gas flow. They exhibited catalytic activity higher than the one in the PS form.

We assume periodic distribution with size epsilon of the "holes" B-epsilon but no periodicity is assumed on the matrices A(epsilon). The high contrast between the two components is characterized by the assumption that the sequence alpha(epsilon) decreases towards zero. We study the three regimes corresponding to the limits alpha := lim(epsilon -> 0) alpha(epsilon)/epsilon. It is shown in particular that in the case alpha = 0, the inclusions B-epsilon behave as holes on the macroscopic diffusion process.

The final target was then assayed for anti-biofilm activity against three Gram-negative marine bacteria, Pseudoalteromonas ulvae (TC14), Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica (TC8) and Paracoccus sp. (4M6). Most of the synthesised bromotyramine/triazole derivatives are more active than the parent natural products Moloka'iamine (A) and 3,5-dibromo-4-methoxy-beta-phenethylamine (B) against biofilm formation by the three bacterial strains. Some of these compounds were shown to act as non-toxic inhibitors of biofilm development with EC50 < 200 mu M without any effect on bacterial growth even at high concentrations (200 mu M).

An experimental protocol was optimized to specifically extract algal surface-associated metabolites by a technique involving dipping in organic solvents whilst the integrity of algal cell membranes was assessed by fluorescent microscopy. This methodology was validated using mass spectrometry-based profiles of algal extracts and analysis of their principal components, which led to the selection of methanol as the extraction solvent with a maximum exposure time of 15 s. Six compounds (A-F) were identified in the resulting surface extracts. Two of these surface-associated compounds (B and C) showed selective anti-adhesion properties against reference bacterial strains isolated from artificial surfaces while remaining inactive against epibiotic bacteria of T. atomaria. Such specificity was not observed for commercial antifouling biocides and other molecules identified in the surface or whole-cell extracts of T. atomaria.

Samples were collected in a mesocosm fertilized with phosphate at depths of 1, 6 and 12m and in the surrounding waters. Light absorption coefficients of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) [a(g) (lambda)] and particulate matter [a(p) (lambda)] were determined using a point-source integrating-cavity absorption meter (PSICAM), while fluorescent DOM (FDOM) components were determined from excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The evolutions of a(g) (lambda) and a(p) (lambda) in the mesocosm were similar to those of total chlorophyll a concentration, Synechococcus spp. and picoeukaryote abundances, bacterial production, particulate organic nitrogen and total organic carbon concentrations, with roughly a decrease from the beginning of the experiment to days 9-10, and an increase from days 9-10 to the end of the experiment. In the surrounding waters, the same trend was observed but the increase was much less pronounced, emphasizing the effect of the phosphate fertilization on the mesocosm's plankton community. Correlations suggested that both Synechococcus cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were strongly involved in the production of CDOM and absorption of particulate matter. The increase in phytoplankton biomass during the second part of the experiment led to a higher contribution of particulate material in the absorption budget at 442 nm. The three FDOM components identified (tryptophan-, tyrosine-and ultraviolet C (UVC) humic-like fluorophores) did not follow the evolution of CDOM and particulate matter, suggesting they were driven by different production/degradation processes. Finally, the results of this work support the idea there is indirect coupling between the dynamics of N-2 fixation and that of chromophoric material via the stimulation of Synechococcus bloom.

Due to the translational invariance, this operator admits a fiber decomposition and a family of dispersion curves that are real analytic functions. Each of them is simple and monotonically decreasing from positive infinity to a finite value, which is the corresponding Landau level. These finite limits are thresholds in the purely absolutely continuous spectrum of the magnetic Laplacian. We prove a limiting absorption principle for this operator, both outside and at the thresholds. Finally, we establish analytic and decay properties for functions lying in the absorption spaces. We point out that the analysis carried out in this article is rather general, and can be adapted to a wide class of fibered magnetic Laplacians with thresholds in their spectrum that are finite limits of their band functions.

The developed approach consists in a penalized maximum likelihood estimation carried out by a robust expectation-maximization (EM)-like algorithm. We derive it for polynomial, spline, and B-spline regression mixtures. The proposed learning approach is unsupervised: (i) it simultaneously infers the model parameters and the optimal number of the regression mixture components from the data as the learning proceeds, rather than in a two-fold scheme as in standard model-based clustering using afterward model selection criteria, and (ii) it does not require accurate initialization unlike the standard EM for regression mixtures. The developed approach is applied to curve clustering problems. Numerical experiments on simulated and real data show that the proposed algorithm performs well and provides accurate clustering results, and confirm its benefit for practical applications.

Dimension reduction for compressible pipe flows including friction								ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS				98	3			237	255		10.3233/ASY-161367			2016	2016	We present the full derivation of a one dimensional "Saint-Venant" like equations for barotropic compressible pipe flows including friction. The one dimensional hyperbolic system is called gamma-pressurized model where gamma is the adiabatic constant. It is obtained through the three dimensional barotropic Navier-Stokes equations under "thin layer" assumptions as a first order approximation. Prescribing suitable boundary conditions, one can introduce a general friction law and then explicitly show its geometrical (w.r.t the hydraulic radius) and hydrodynamical (w.r.t the Oser number) dependencies in the reduced model. In particular, for linear pressure law (gamma = 1), we justify the one dimensional pressurized model (called P-model) introduced by the author in the context of unsteady mixed flows in closed water pipes. For non linear pressure law (gamma not equal 1), the gamma-pressurized model describes the evolution of a compressible (almost) gravityless flow.

However, the magnitude of interspecific competition for food in bivalve aquaculture settings remains inconclusive, especially in tropical areas. We investigated the interactions for food between the farmed pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera and its epibionts, using stable isotope analysis and feeding experiments. Inter-and intraspecific variations of delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope ratios (SIRs) were determined for oysters in the presence or absence of epibionts. The diet of the most abundant epibionts, Herdmania momus and Didemnum sp., was specified using isotope measurements and flow cytometry during feeding experiments, to determine the main phytoplankton groups consumed by these ascidians in natural conditions. The absence of intraspecific variation in SIRs among oysters with or without epibionts suggested that the diet of P. margaritifera was not affected by the presence of epibionts, indicating a reduced diet overlap and no food limitation. The delta C-13 signature of ascidians (-21 parts per thousand) was lower than that of oysters (-18 parts per thousand), indicating a difference in organic matter sources ingested by these filter feeders despite receiving the same food mixture. While the main carbon source of oysters came from large particulate organic matter (POM) > 20 mu m, our results showed that the diet of ascidians mainly came from smaller particles (POM < 20 mu m) and reflects the composition of ambient water (mainly picophytoplankton < 2 mu m), which confirmed their lack of food selectivity. In the studied conditions, food competition between oysters and epibionts, specifically ascidians, was not a limiting factor, in spite of a diet overlap for nanophytoplankton.

The aim of the characterization (colorimetric methods, FTIR, GC-MS, NMR, HPGPC, and AFM analyses) was to identify new anti-biofilm compounds; activity was assessed using the BioFilm Ring Test (R). A step-wise separation of EPS was designed, based on differences in water-solubility and acidity. An acidic fraction was isolated from TB-EPS, which strongly inhibited biofilm formation by marine bacterial strains in a concentration-dependent manner. The main constituents of this fraction were characterized as two glucan-like polysaccharides. An active poly(glutamyl-glutamate) fraction was also recovered from TB-EPS. The distribution of these key EPS components in Sol-EPS, LB-EPS, and TB-EPS was distinct and differed quantitatively in biofilm vs planktonic cultures. The anti-biofilm potential of the fractions emphasizes the putative antifouling role of EPS in the environment.

A series of linear graft copolymers have been synthesized by RAFT polymerization of trialkylsilyl methacrylates (TASMA) with two types of commercially available methacryloxypropyl-substituted polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMSMA) as macromonomers. The resulting poly(PDMSMA)-g-poly(TASMA) graft copolymers exhibited various branching distributions depending on the reactivity of the monomers used. We were able to control graft densities of the copolymers by using two TASMA monomers with substantially different reactivities, e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl methacrylate (TBDMSMA) vs. tri-isopropylsilyl methacrylate (TIPSMA). While TBDMSMA-based statistical copolymers were heterogeneously branched their counterparts (i.e. TIPSMA-based statistical copolymers) had PDMS side chains more homogeneously distributed along their backbones. The monomer reactivity ratios (r) were determined by using the Jaacks method. In addition, diblock copolymers of PDMSMA and TASMA were synthesized by chain extension of a macro RAFT agent easily available in one synthetic step from PDMS-containing starting materials. Copolymers with well-controlled molar masses and low dispersities were obtained, indicating relatively fast initiation and minimal side reactions. The surface energy and erosion properties in these copolymers were investigated in artificial seawater in order to apply them as binders in self-polishing/fouling release hybrid antifouling coatings.

In the unimodal case, the system exhibits a discontinuous hysteretic transition from an incoherent to a partially synchronized (PS) state. For sufficiently large inertia, the system reveals the coexistence of a PS state and of a standing wave (SW) solution. In the bimodal case, the hysteretic synchronization transition involves several states. Namely, the system becomes coherent passing through traveling waves (TWs), SWs and finally arriving to a PS regime. The transition to the PS state from the SW occurs always at the same coupling, independently of the system size, while its value increases linearly with the inertia. On the other hand the critical coupling required to observe TWs and SWs increases with N suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit the transition from incoherence to PS will occur without any intermediate states. Finally a linear stability analysis reveals that the system is hysteretic not only at the level of macroscopic indicators, but also microscopically as verified by measuring the maximal Lyapunov exponent.

The reference measurements of this nuclear heating are especially performed by a differential calorimeter including a graphite sample material. Then these measurements are used for other materials, other geometries, or other experimental conditions in order to predict the nuclear heating and thermal conditions induced in the irradiation devices. This paper will present new simulations with MCNP Monte-Carlo transport code to determine the gamma heating profile inside the calorimeter. The whole complex geometry of the sensor has been considered. We use as an input source in the model, the photon spectra calculated in various positions of CARMEN-1 irradiation program in OSIRIS reactor. After a description of the differential calorimeter device, the MCNP modeling used for the calculations of radial profile of nuclear heating inside the calorimeter elements will be introduced. The obtained results of different simulations will be detailed and discussed in this paper. The charged particle equilibrium inside the calorimeter elements will be studied. Then we will focus on parametric studies of the various components of the calorimeter. The influence of source type will be also took into account. Moreover the influence of the material used for the sample will be described.

The crystal structure evolved with Sr/Ba ratio from cubic Frn (3) over barm for x=0, via tetragonal 14/m for x=0.25, to monoclinic P2(1)/n for x >= 0.5, as verified by Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffractograms as well as by Raman spectroscopy.

A statistical algorithm is proposed to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration ([chl-a]) in optically complex waters of the New Caledonian lagoon from MODIS-derived remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). The algorithm is developed via supervised learning on match-ups gathered from 2002 to 2010. The best performance is obtained by combining two models, selected according to the ratio of R-rs in spectral bands centered on 488 and 555 nm: a log-linear model for low [chl-a] (AFLC) and a support vector machine (SVM) model or a classic model (OC3) for high [chl-a]. The log-linear model is developed based on SVM regression analysis. This approach outperforms the classical OC3 approach, especially in shallow waters, with a root mean squared error 30% lower. The proposed algorithm enables more accurate assessments of [chl-a] and its variability in this typical oligo- to meso-trophic tropical lagoon, from shallow coastal waters and nearby reefs to deeper waters and in the open ocean.

These monomers were prepared in an efficient way from organic azides and propargyl acrylate via a copper catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Polymers containing bromotyramine as a pendant group were obtained via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The influence of the chain transfer agent (CTA), solvent, temperature and the length of the linker between the triazole and bromotyramine groups on the polymerization kinetics was studied. It was found that triazoles containing acrylate monomers are characterized by fast polymerization and polymers with controlled molar masses (20 000 g mol(-1)) and low dispersities (DM < 1.5) can be prepared. Glass transition temperatures of these acrylic polymers ranged from 48 degrees C to 20 degrees C by controlling the length of the linker between the bromotyramine side groups and the backbone.

It applies successfully on timescales and length scales that differ several orders of magnitude: to chemical reactions, breaking of chemical bonds, unfolding of proteins and RNA structures and polymers crossing entropic barriers. Here we apply TST to out-of-equilibrium transport through confined environments: the thermally activated translocation of single DNA molecules over an entropic barrier helped by an external force field. Reaction pathways are effectively one dimensional and so long that they are observable in a microscope. Reaction rates are so slow that transitions are recorded on video. We find sharp transition states that are independent of the applied force, similar to chemical bond rupture, as well as transition states that change location on the reaction pathway with the strength of the applied force. The states of equilibrium and transition are separated by micrometres as compared with angstroms/nanometres for chemical bonds.

A detailed study of these tools allows the identification of the methods already used to evaluate the failure risk corresponding to specific types of SEE. A comparative study will allow the determination of their relevance. The implementation of the most suitable tool suite in an engineering software is a long and complex process. To demonstrate its feasibility, a list of selected models was made to build a simple method. It was used to perform an SEE simulation on a realistic model of SRAM device.

For that reason, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm is essential so that it is possible to draw peak power from the photovoltaic panel to obtain the maximized produced energy. The main purpose of MPPT technique is to make sure that the solar panel is producing the maximum power. This extracts the maximum amount of power at any given time. To figure out which MPPT technique has the best performances, this paper introduces six different MPPT algorithms existing in literature. In particular, these techniques are tested while the temperature cell was randomly varied. The simulation results are evaluated using Matlab-Simulink.

The social attitude expressed by an agent should reflect the social situation of the interaction. The agent ought to take into account its role and its social relation toward its interactants when deciding how to react in the interaction. To build such an agent able to reason about its role and relation and to adapt its social attitude, we build a model of social decision making.

Much work has been done on the analysis of the currents associated with states whose energy is located between Landau levels. These edge states carry a non-zero current that remains well-localized in a neighborhood of the boundary. In this article, we study the behavior of states with energies close to a Landau level. Such states are referred to as bulk states in the physics literature. Since the magnetic Schrodinger operator is invariant with respect to translations along the edge, it is a direct integral of operators indexed by a real wave number. We analyse these fiber operators and prove new asymptotics on the band functions and their first derivative as the wave number goes to infinity. We apply these results to prove that the current carried by a bulk state is small compared to the current carried by an edge state. We also prove that the bulk states are small near the edge.

J	Camps, Mercedes; Benavides, Mar; Lema, Kimberley A.; Bourne, David G.; Grosso, Olivier; Bonnet, Sophie								Released coral mucus does not enhance planktonic N-2 fixation rates								AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				77	1			51	63		10.3354/ame01787			2016	2016	Dinitrogen (N-2) fixation by prokaryotic microorganisms provides bioavailable nitrogen in oligotrophic marine ecosystems such as coral reefs. The widespread though largely unknown heterotrophic diazotrophs require dissolved organic matter (DOM) for their nutrition. In coral reef ecosystems, DOM-rich mucus released by corals potentially sustains heterotrophic diazotrophic growth and activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of coral mucus on planktonic N-2 fixation in in situ experiments over a seasonal cycle within a New Caledonian lagoon, as well as in in vitro experiments in which the effect of mucus was monitored for 72 h. During the field experiment, N-2 fixation rates ranged between 0.12 and 7.90 nmol N1(-1) d(-1). Despite the highest N-2 fixation being found after mucus release, no significant difference was measured between the seawater surrounding the coral before and after mucus release. Similarly, the addition of mucus during the in vitro experiment enhanced N-2 fixation rates 1.5-fold, but this increase was not significantly different from the control. The abundance of 2 dominant populations of diazotrophs associated with corals and their surrounding seawater environments (unicellular cyanobacteria and rhizobia) found within pure mucus samples was on average 18-fold higher than in the surrounding seawater in the summer period and 400-fold higher in the winter. Our results suggest that although coral mucus does not influence planktonic N-2 fixation, the release of large numbers of diazotrophic cells associated with the mucus likely influences the abundance and diversity of diazotroph populations within the lagoon waters.

Meltwater tends to stabilize the ocean column, inducing amplifying feedbacks that increase subsurface ocean warming and ice shelf melting. Cold meltwater and induced dynamical effects cause ocean surface cooling in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, thus increasing Earth's energy imbalance and heat flux into most of the global ocean's surface. Southern Ocean surface cooling, while lower latitudes are warming, increases precipitation on the Southern Ocean, increasing ocean stratification, slowing deepwater formation, and increasing ice sheet mass loss. These feedbacks make ice sheets in contact with the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize that ice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea level several meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linear response. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield multi-meter sea level rise in about 50, 100 or 200 years. Recent ice melt doubling times are near the lower end of the 10-40-year range, but the record is too short to confirm the nature of the response. The feedbacks, including subsurface ocean warming, help explain paleoclimate data and point to a dominant Southern Ocean role in controlling atmospheric CO2, which in turn exercised tight control on global temperature and sea level. The millennial (500-2000-year) timescale of deep-ocean ventilation affects the timescale for natural CO2 change and thus the timescale for paleo-global climate, ice sheet, and sea level changes, but this paleo-millennial timescale should not be misinterpreted as the timescale for ice sheet response to a rapid, large, human-made climate forcing. These climate feedbacks aid interpretation of events late in the prior interglacial, when sea level rose to +6-9 m with evidence of extreme storms while Earth was less than 1 A degrees C warmer than today. Ice melt cooling of the North Atlantic and Southern oceans increases atmospheric temperature gradients, eddy kinetic energy and baroclinicity, thus driving more powerful storms. The modeling, paleoclimate evidence, and ongoing observations together imply that 2 A degrees C global warming above the preindustrial level could be dangerous. Continued high fossil fuel emissions this century are predicted to yield (1) cooling of the Southern Ocean, especially in the Western Hemisphere; (2) slowing of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, warming of the ice shelves, and growing ice sheet mass loss; (3) slowdown and eventual shutdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation with cooling of the North Atlantic region; (4) increasingly powerful storms; and (5) nonlinearly growing sea level rise, reaching several meters over a timescale of 50-150 years. These predictions, especially the cooling in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic with markedly reduced warming or even cooling in Europe, differ fundamentally from existing climate change assessments. We discuss observations and modeling studies needed to refute or clarify these assertions.

Succession within the prokaryotic communities during the VAHINE mesocosms experiment in the New Caledonia lagoon								BIOGEOSCIENCES				13	8			2319	2337		10.5194/bg-13-2319-2016			2016	2016	N-2 fixation fuels similar to 50% of new primary production in the oligotrophic South Pacific Ocean. The VAHINE experiment has been designed to track the fate of diazotroph-derived nitrogen (DDN) and carbon within a coastal lagoon ecosystem in a comprehensive way. For this, large-volume (similar to 50 m(3)) mesocosms were deployed in the New Caledonian lagoon and were intentionally fertilized with dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) to stimulate N-2 fixation. This study examined the temporal dynamics of the prokaryotic community together with the evolution of biogeochemical parameters for 23 consecutive days in one of these mesocosms (M1) and in the Noumea lagoon using MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing and flow cytometry. Combining these methods allowed for inference of absolute cell numbers from 16S data. We observed clear successions within M1, some of which were not mirrored in the lagoon. The dominating classes in M1 were Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, eukaryotic microalgae, Marine Group II Euryarchaeota, Flavobacteriia, and Acidimicrobia. Enclosure led to significant changes in the M1 microbial community, probably initiated by the early decay of Synechococcus and diatoms. However, we did not detect a pronounced bottle effect with a copiotroph-dominated community. The fertilization with similar to 0.8 mu M DIP on day 4 did not have directly observable effects on the overall community within M1, as the data samples obtained from before and 4 days after fertilization clustered together, but likely influenced the development of individual populations later on, like Defluviicoccus-related bacteria and UCYN-C-type diazotrophic cyanobacteria (Cyanothece). Growth of UCYN-C led to among the highest N-2-fixation rates ever measured in this region and enhanced growth of nearly all abundant heterotrophic groups in M1. We further show that different Rhodobacteraceae were the most efficient heterotrophs in the investigated system and we observed niche partitioning within the SAR86 clade. Whereas the location in-or outside the mesocosm had a significant effect on community composition, the temporal effect was significantly stronger and similar in both locations, suggesting that overarching abiotic factors were more influential than the enclosure. While temporal community changes were evident, prokaryotic diversity (Shannon index) only declined slightly from similar to 6.5 to 5.7 or 6.05 in the lagoon and M1, respectively, throughout the experiment, highlighting the importance of multiple and varying sources of organic matter maintaining competition.

The mesocosms were fertilized with similar to 0.8 mu M dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) to stimulate diazotrophy. Bulk N-2 fixation rates were replicable between the three mesocosms, averaged 18.5 +/- 1.1 nmol N L-1 d(-1) over the 23 days, and increased by a factor of 2 during the second half of the experiment (days 15 to 23) to reach 27.3 +/- 1.0 nmol N L-1 d(-1). These later rates measured after the DIP fertilization are higher than the upper range reported for the global ocean. During the 23 days of the experiment, N-2 fixation rates were positively correlated with seawater temperature, primary production, bacterial production, standing stocks of particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PON) and phosphorus (POP), and alkaline phosphatase activity, and negatively correlated with DIP concen-trations, DIP turnover time, nitrate, and dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. The fate of DDN was investigated during a bloom of the unicellular diazotroph UCYN-C that occurred during the second half of the experiment. Quantification of diazotrophs in the sediment traps indicates that similar to 10 % of UCYN-C from the water column was exported daily to the traps, representing as much as 22.4 +/- 5.5 % of the total POC exported at the height of the UCYN-C bloom. This export was mainly due to the aggregation of small (5.7 +/- 0.8 mu m) UCYN-C cells into large (100-500 mu m) aggregates. During the same time period, a DDN transfer experiment based on high-resolution nanometerscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) coupled with N-15(2) isotopic labeling revealed that 16 +/- 6 % of the DDN was released to the dissolved pool and 21 +/- 4 % was transferred to non-diazotrophic plankton, mainly picoplankton (18 +/- 4 %) followed by diatoms (3 +/- 2 %). This is consistent with the observed dramatic increase in picoplankton and diatom abundances, primary production, bacterial production, and standing stocks of POC, PON, and POP in the mesocosms during the second half of the experiment. These results offer insights into the fate of DDN during a bloom of UCYN-C in low-nutrient, low-chlorophyll ecosystems.

The main goal of the VAriability of vertical and tropHlc transfer of diazotroph derived N in the south wEst Pacific (VAHINE) project was to study the fate of nitrogen newly fixed by diazotrophs (or diazotroph-derived nitrogen) in oceanic food webs, and how it impacts heterotrophic bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics, stocks and fluxes of biogenic elements and particle export. Three large volume (similar to 50 m(3)) mesocosms were deployed in a tropical oligotrophic ecosystem (the New Caledonia lagoon, southeastern Pacific) and intentionally fertilized with similar to 0.8 mu M of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) to stimulate diazotrophy and follow subsequent ecosystem changes. VAHINE was a multidisciplinary project involving close collaborations between biogeochemists, molecular ecologist, chemists, marine opticians and modellers. This introductory paper describes in detail the scientific objectives of the project as well as the implementation plan: the mesocosm description and deployment, the selection of the study site (New Caledonian lagoon), and the logistical and sampling strategy. The main hydrological and biogeochemical conditions of the study site before the mesocosm deployment and during the experiment itself are described, and a general overview of the papers published in this special issue is presented.

The VAHINE (VAriability of vertical and tropHIc transfer of fixed N-2 in the south-wEst Pacific) experiment was designed to examine the fate of diazotroph-derived nitrogen (DDN) in such ecosystems. In austral summer 2013, three large ( similar to aEuro parts per thousand aEuro-50aEuro-m(3)) in situ mesocosms were deployed for 23 days in the New Caledonia lagoon, an ecosystem that typifies the low-nutrient, low-chlorophyll environment, to stimulate diazotroph production. The zooplankton component of the study aimed to measure the incorporation of DDN into zooplankton biomass, and assess the role of direct diazotroph grazing by zooplankton as a DDN uptake pathway. Inside the mesocosms, the diatom-diazotroph association (DDA) het-1 predominated during days 5-15 while the unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria UCYN-C predominated during days 15-23. A Trichodesmium bloom was observed in the lagoon (outside the mesocosms) towards the end of the experiment. The zooplankton community was dominated by copepods (63aEuro-% of total abundance) for the duration of the experiment. Using two-source N isotope mixing models we estimated a mean similar to aEuro parts per thousand aEuro-28aEuro-% contribution of DDN to zooplankton nitrogen biomass at the start of the experiment, indicating that the natural summer peak of N-2 fixation in the lagoon was already contributing significantly to the zooplankton. Stimulation of N-2 fixation in the mesocosms corresponded with a generally low-level enhancement of DDN contribution to zooplankton nitrogen biomass, but with a peak of similar to aEuro parts per thousand aEuro-73aEuro-% in mesocosm 1 following the UCYN-C bloom. qPCR analysis targeting four of the common diazotroph groups present in the mesocosms (Trichodesmium, het-1, het-2, UCYN-C) demonstrated that all four were ingested by copepod grazers, and that their abundance in copepod stomachs generally corresponded with their in situ abundance. N-15(2) labelled grazing experiments therefore provided evidence for direct ingestion and assimilation of UCYN-C-derived N by the zooplankton, but not for het-1 and Trichodesmium, supporting an important role of secondary pathways of DDN to the zooplankton for the latter groups, i.e. DDN contributions to the dissolved N pool and uptake by nondiazotrophs. This study appears to provide the first evidence of direct UCYN-C grazing by zooplankton, and indicates that UCYN-C-derived N contributes significantly to the zooplankton food web in the New Caledonia lagoon through a combination of direct grazing and secondary pathways.

In particular, the role played by heterotrophic prokaryotes in this transfer is largely unknown. In the frame of the VAHINE (VAriability of vertical and tropHIc transfer of diazotroph derived N in the south wEst Pacific) experiment, three replicate large-volume (similar to 50 m(3)) mesocosms were deployed for 23 days in the new Caledonia lagoon and were intentionally fertilized on day 4 with dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) to stimulate N-2 fixation. We specifically examined relationships between heterotrophic bacterial production (BP) and N-2 fixation or primary production, determined bacterial growth efficiency and established carbon budgets. BP was statistically higher during the second phase of the experiment (P2: days 15-23), when chlorophyll biomass started to increase compared to the first phase (P1: days 5-14). Phosphatase alkaline activity increased drastically during the second phase of the experiment, showing adaptations of microbial populations after utilization of the added DIP. Notably, among autotrophs, Synechococcus abundances increased during P2, possibly related to its capacity to assimilate leucine and to produce alkaline phosphatase. Bacterial growth efficiency based on the carbon budget (27-43 %), was notably higher than generally cited for oligotrophic environments and discussed in links with the presence of abundant species of bacteria expressing proteorhodopsin. The main fates of gross primary production (particulate C dissolved) were respiration (67 %) and export through sedimentation (17 %). BP was highly correlated with particulate primary production and chlorophyll biomass during both phases of the experiment but was slightly correlated, and only during P2 phase, with N-2 fixation rates. Heterotrophic bacterial production was strongly stimulated after mineral N enrichment experiments, suggesting N-limitation of heterotrophic bacteria across the experiment. N-2 fixation rates corresponded to 17-37% of the nitrogen demand of heterotrophic bacteria. Our results suggest that most of the diazotroph-derived nitrogen fuelled the heterotrophic bacterial community through indirect processes generating dissolved organic matter and detritus, like mortality, lysis and grazing of both diazotrophs and non-diazotrophs.

We characterized spatial and temporal dynamics of TEP during the VAHINE experiment that investigated the fate of diazotroph-derived nitrogen and carbon in three replicate dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP)-fertilized 50aEuro-m(3) enclosures in the oligotrophic New Caledonian lagoon. During the 23 days of the experiment, we did not observe any depth-dependent changes in TEP concentrations in the three sampled depths (1, 6, 12aEuro-m). TEP carbon (TEP-C) content averaged 28.9 < mspace width='0.125em' linebreak='nobreak'/> +/- 9.3 and 27.0 < mspace width='0.125em' linebreak='nobreak'/> +/- 7.2aEuro-% of total organic carbon (TOC) in the mesocosms and surrounding lagoon respectively and was strongly and positively coupled with TOC during P2 (i.e., days 15-23). TEP concentrations in the mesocosms declined for the first 9 days after DIP fertilization (P1aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand= aEuro-days 5-14) and then gradually increased during the second phase. Temporal changes in TEP concentrations paralleled the growth and mortality rates of the diatom-diazotroph association of Rhizosolenia and Richelia that predominated the diazotroph community during P1. By P2, increasing total primary and heterotrophic bacterial production consumed the supplemented P and reduced availability of DIP. For this period, TEP concentrations were negatively correlated with DIP availability and turnover time of DIP (T-DIP), while positively associated with enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) that occurs when the microbial populations are P stressed. During P2, increasing bacterial production (BP) was positively correlated with higher TEP concentrations, which were also coupled with the increased growth rates and aggregation of the unicellular cyanobacterial Group C (UCYN-C) diazotrophs that bloomed during this period. We conclude that the composite processes responsible for the formation and breakdown of TEP yielded a relatively stable TEP pool available as both a carbon source and facilitating aggregation and flux throughout the experiment. TEP were probably mostly influenced by abiotic physical processes during P1, while biological activity (BP, diazotrophic growth and aggregation, export production) mainly impacted TEP concentrations during P2 when DIP availability was limited.

BIOGEOSCIENCES				13	13			4005	4021		10.5194/bg-13-4005-2016			2016	2016	Biological dinitrogen (N-2) fixation is the major source of new nitrogen (N) for the open ocean, and thus promotes marine productivity, in particular in the vast N-depleted regions of the surface ocean. Yet, the fate of the diazotroph-derived N (DDN) in marine ecosystems is poorly understood, and its transfer to auto-and heterotrophic surrounding plankton communities is rarely measured due to technical limitations. Moreover, the different diazotrophs involved in N-2 fixation (Trichodesmium spp. vs. UCYN) exhibit distinct patterns of N-2 fixation and inhabit different ecological niches, thus having potentially different fates in the marine food webs that remain to be explored. Here we used nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) coupled with N-15(2) isotopic labelling and flow cytometry cell sorting to examine the DDN transfer to specific groups of natural phytoplankton and bacteria during artificially induced diazotroph blooms in New Caledonia (southwestern Pacific). The fate of the DDN was compared according to the three diazotrophs: the filamentous and colony-forming Trichodesmium erythraeum (IMS101), and the unicellular strains Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501 and Cyanothece ATCC51142. After 48 h, 7-17% of the N-2 fixed during the experiment was transferred to the dissolved pool and 6-12% was transferred to non-diazotrophic plankton. The transfer was twice as high in the T. erythraeum bloom than in the C. watsonii and Cyanothece blooms, which shows that filamentous diazotrophs blooms are more efficient at promoting non-diazotrophic production in N-depleted areas. The amount of DDN released in the dissolved pool did not appear to be a good indicator of the DDN transfer efficiency towards the non-diazotrophic plankton. In contrast, the N-15-enrichment of the extracellular ammonium (NH4+) pool was a good indicator of the DDN transfer efficiency: it was significantly higher in the T. erythraeum than in unicellular diazotroph blooms, leading to a DDN transfer twice as efficient. This suggests that NH4+ was the main pathway of the DDN transfer from diazotrophs to non-diazotrophs. The three simulated diazotroph blooms led to significant increases in non-diazotrophic plankton biomass. This increase in biomass was first associated with heterotrophic bacteria followed by phytoplankton, indicating that heterotrophs took the most advantage of the DDN in this oligotrophic ecosystem.

Global analysis of gene expression dynamics within the marine microbial community during the VAHINE mesocosm experiment in the southwest Pacific								BIOGEOSCIENCES				13	14			4135	4149		10.5194/bg-13-4135-2016			2016	2016	Microbial gene expression was followed for 23 days within a mesocosm (M1) isolating 50m(3) of seawater and in the surrounding waters in the Noumea lagoon, New Caledonia, in the southwest Pacific as part of the VAriability of vertical and tropHIc transfer of diazotroph derived N in the south wEst Pacific (VAHINE) experiment. The aim of VAHINE was to examine the fate of diazotroph-derived nitrogen (DDN) in a low-nutrient, low-chlorophyll ecosystem. On day 4 of the experiment, the mesocosm was fertilized with phosphate. In the lagoon, gene expression was dominated by the cyanobacterium Synechococcus, closely followed by Alphaproteobacteria. In contrast, drastic changes in the microbial community composition and transcriptional activity were triggered within the mesocosm within the first 4 days, with transcription bursts from different heterotrophic bacteria in rapid succession. The microbial composition and activity of the surrounding lagoon ecosystem appeared more stable, although following similar temporal trends as in M1. We detected significant gene expression from Chromerida in M1, as well as the Noumea lagoon, suggesting these photoautotrophic alveolates were present in substantial numbers in the open water. Other groups contributing substantially to the metatranscriptome were affiliated with marine Euryarchaeota Candidatus Thalassoarchaea (inside and outside) and Myoviridae bacteriophages likely infecting Synechococcus, specifically inside M1. High transcript abundances for ammonium transporters and glutamine synthetase in many different taxa (e.g., Pelagibacteraceae, Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, and Rhodobacteraceae) was consistent with the known preference of most bacteria for this nitrogen source. In contrast, Alteromonadaceae highly expressed urease genes; Rhodobacteraceae and Prochlorococcus showed some urease expression, too. Nitrate reductase transcripts were detected on day 10 very prominently in Synechococcus and in Halomonadaceae. Alkaline phosphatase was expressed prominently only between days 12 and 23 in different organisms, suggesting that the microbial community was not limited by phosphate, even before the fertilization on day 4, whereas the post-fertilization community was. We observed high expression of the Synechococcus sqdB gene, only transiently lowered following phosphate fertilization. SqdB encodes UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, possibly enabling marine picocyanobacteria to minimize their phosphorus requirements by substitution of phospholipids with sulphur-containing glycerolipids. This result suggests a link between sqdB expression and phosphate availability in situ. Gene expression of diazotrophic cyanobacteria was mainly attributed to Trichodesmium and Richelia intracellularis (diatom-diazotroph association) in the Noumea lagoon and initially in M1. UCYN-A (Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium) transcripts were the third most abundant and declined both inside and outside after day 4, consistent with 16S- and nifH-based analyses. Transcripts related to the Epithemia turgida endosymbiont and Cyanothece ATCC 51142 increased during the second half of the experiment.

We investigated the cellular processes mediating Trichodesmium mortality from large surface accumulations (blooms) in the lagoon. Trichodesmium cells (and associated microbiota) were collected at the time of surface accumulation, enclosed under simulated ambient conditions, and sampled over time to elucidate the stressors and subcellular underpinning of rapid biomass demise (>90% biomass crashed within similar to 24 h). Metatranscriptomic profiling of Trichodesmium biomass, 0, 8 and 22 h after incubations of surface accumulations, demonstrated upregulated expression of genes required to increase phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) availability and transport, while genes responsible for nutrient storage were downregulated. Total viral abundance oscillated throughout the experiment and showed no significant relationship with the development or demise of the Trichodesmium biomass. Enhanced caspase-specific activity and upregulated expression of a suite of metacaspase genes, as the Trichodesmium biomass crashed, implied autocatalytic programmed cell death (PCD) as the mechanistic cause. Concurrently, genes associated with buoyancy and gas vesicle production were strongly downregulated concomitant with increased production and high concentrations of transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP). The rapid, PCD-mediated, decline of the Trichodesmium biomass, as we observed from our incubations, parallels mortality rates reported from Trichodesmium blooms in situ. Our results suggest that, whatever the ultimate factor, PCD-mediated death in Trichodesmium can rapidly terminate blooms, facilitate aggregation, and expedite vertical flux to depth.

Both speciation and release of As from this soil was followed under anaerobic conditions using a laboratory batch experiment. In the presence of exogenous carbon sources, As-V initially present in the soil matrix and/or adsorbed on synthetic hydrous ferric oxides were solubilized and mainly reduced to As-III by indigenous soil microflora. After a 1-month incubation period in these biotic conditions, As-III accounted for 80-85% of the total dissolved As and more than 60% of the solid-phase As. Bacterial community structure (i.e., 16S rDNA-based capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism profiles) changed with incubation time and As amendment. The detection of distantly related arsenate respiratory reductase genes (arrA), as functional markers of As-V respirers, indicates that novel dissimilatory As-V-reducing bacteria may be involved in As biotransformation and mobility in anoxic soils. Since As and iron were concomitantly released, a crucial role of indirect As-mobilizing bacteria on As behavior was also revealed. Our results show that the majority of As within the soil matrix was bioavailable and bioaccessible for heterotrophic As-V reduction to As-III, which may increase As toxicity and mobility in the contaminated soils.

However, it is generally considered that the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy truly became unconventional only at a late stage. Our contribution is threefold. We first show that the notion of "conventional" monetary policy, which is the reference of this assessment, is a recent theoretical construction. Secondly, the mandate of the ECB, which is its institutional expression, may raise specific difficulties in managing major financial crises, particularly with regards to the forward guidance of expectations and the commitment to an accommodative policy. Finally, the resulting policies have, at this stage, paradoxically achieved acceptable levels of macroeconomic and overall financial stability, but failed to restore a private funding supply to the banking sector enabling it to play its normal role in financing economic activity.

Vegetation shifts can alter the Sphagnum decomposition rate through a litter mixture effect. This is rarely studied in peatlands. In a site colonised by vascular plants, we examined the effect of mixing litters of Sphagnum species with those of Molinia caerulea and Betula spp. on litter carbon (C) dynamics. We tested that water content and pH may explain the potential non-additive litter mixing effect. Litter bags with Sphagnum cuspidatum or Sphagnum rubellum and M. caerulea or Betula spp. were placed in situ, in a Sphagnum decomposing environment and retrieved after 1 year of incubation. In the laboratory, the specific interaction between S. rubellum and M. caerulea was investigated. Solid, soluble and gaseous forms of C were studied in addition to the fluorescence of the dissolved organic matter (FDOM). Laboratory and field experiments showed that there is a non-additive effect of mixing S. rubellum and M. caerulea litter on C dynamics. The analyses of FDOM suggested a relatively higher living biomass in the laboratory-measured mixture than in the expected one. The in situ S. rubellum moist environment could stimulate the decomposition of M. caerulea that experiences much drier conditions in its native environment. In the laboratory experiment, M. caerulea were kept moist, and no significant difference in water content between the measured and expected mixture was found. Also, pH decreased in the measured mixture, ruling out any direct effect on microbial activity. The non-additive mixture effect observed in the laboratory may be triggered by an increase of the microbial biomass. This increase was not explained by direct moisture or a pH effect. The suggested hypothesis that a lower pH could affect the availability of labile organic substrate through increased organic matter (OM) hydrolysis and thus stimulate microbial growth has to be further studied.

The aim of this study was to investigate sites responsible for copper binding in root apoplasts, i.e. CW and outer surface of the plasma membrane (PM) continuum. Binding sites in root apoplasts were investigated by comparing isolated CW of a monocotyledon (Triticum aestivum L.) and dicotyledon (Solanum lycopersicum L.) crop with their respective whole roots. Copper speciation was examined by X-ray absorption (XAS) and C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies while the affinity of ligands involved in copper binding was investigated by modeling copper sorption isotherms. Homogeneous speciation and binding of copper was found in wheat and tomato root apoplasts. Only Cu-N and Cu-O bonds were detected in wheat and tomato root apoplasts. Nitrogen/oxygen ligands were identified in slightly higher proportions (40-70%) than single oxygen ligands. Furthermore, low-and high-affinity binding sites contributed in an almost equivalent proportion to copper binding in root apoplasts. The high-affinity N functional groups embedded in root apoplasts participated in copper binding in the same magnitude than the low-affinity carboxylic groups.

An appropriate fractionation procedure of SOM, consisting in sequential extractions by water, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and potassium pyrophosphate extractions, was applied. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV and fluoiescence spectroscopic properties of organic matter reveal quantitative and qualitative aspects. Spectral indexes such as SUVA(254) (specific UV absorbance), E-2/E-3 and FI (fluorescence index) were used to examine annual changes of SOM in the different fractions. Extractions with pyrophosphate, and in a lesser amount with sodium hydroxide, represented the major part of DOC, for both control and treated soils. Yields of sequential extractions ranged from 16.1% to 16.4% of TOC for these two soils. Compost inputs resulted in evolution of quantitative and qualitative results, especially for water extractable organic matter (WEOM) and pyrophosphate extracts mainly during the first 3 months of this field experiment Study of annual changes of DOC, SUVA254 and E2/E3 index values in treated soil indicated a priming effect during the weeks after compost spreading, in relation with a revitalizing effect of microbial activity. Contributions of organo-mineral interactions and rainfall regulated WEOM amount throughout the year, and the activity of microbial communities in soil seemed to play a significant role on WEOM production. FI index values demonstrated microbial origin for WEOM, and for OM extracted either with acid or with sodium hydroxide. At the contrary, pyrophosphate extracts revealed that OM came essentially from terrestrial origin, which corresponds to the most complex and aromatic compounds. It was found that sodium hydroxide extracted less aromatic SOM, but higher molecular weight compounds. 3D fluorescence spectra revealed the presence of four main types of fluorophores according to the different extracts: humic, fulvic and marine-like compounds (A, C and M) common to all extracts, and lignin-like compounds (H) specific to pyrophosphate extracts only in treated soil at the beginning of the experiment due to initial compost effect PCA on quantitative and qualitative data for WOEM fraction revealed essentially that meteorological aspects, with temperature and precipitation variations, were an important parameter over the year of experimentation, and that compost input impacted significantly WEOM amounts at the beginning of the experiment (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Piazzola, Jacques; Tedeschi, Gilles; Missamou, Tathy								Impact of the Construction of an Offshore Highway on the Sea-Spray Dynamics in La Reunion Island								PLANNING TO COPE WITH TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL CLIMATE CHANGE								130	140					2016	2016	Sea-spray aerosols generated at the sea surface by breaking waves represent a major component of the atmospheric aerosol. In coastal areas, sea-spray particles are continuously produced by the breaking wave processes that occur near the shoreline. In La Reunion, a small island located in the Indian Ocean in the southern hemisphere, a road with an important traffic follows the northwest coast, which includes a cliff barrier. These cliffs, identified as a sensitive ecological space, undergo the influence of sea-sprays generated through breaking waves for prolonged periods of time. However, a new road project, which should be built offshore on the northwest coast of the island, raised some questions about possible impact of the increase of the distance between the hills and the sea-spray production sources on the introduction of exotic species. The present paper then proposes a study of the impact due to the new configuration of the shoreline on the sea-spray transport towards the hill barrier. To this end, simulations were made using a model for the marine aerosol transport in coastal areas, the model MACMod (Tedeschi and Piazzola 2011). This model was implemented on the study area on the basis of a survey of the aerosol size distributions measured on the La Reunion Island from July to September 2012. The influence of the distance to the shoreline on the local sea-spray dynamics was analyzed using a formulation for the sea-spray production in the surf zone through bathymetric processes. The transport calculations were then compared to aerosol data simultaneously measured at 10 meters height on the shoreline and at distance of 150 meters inland for cross-shore winds.

J	Lahouij, Mohamed Anouar								Digital media between radicalization and counter radicalization								RELIGION(S), SECULARITY(IES), SOCIETY(IES) AND THE DIGITAL HUMANITIES TURN								189	199					2016	2016	Terrorist groups have invested considerable resources in the radicalization in Europe and North America. These Westerners have improved terrorist propaganda which were able to generate more media attention because their assumed roles do not fit the typical profile of a terrorist. These terrorists are more familiar with Western culture and less likely to arouse suspicion because of their origin, which increases the probability of committing attacks against well-defended targets. This article provides a descritiv analysis of strategies to counter extremist narratives in the United States and France in order to fight against the radicalization of citizens.

J	Amato, Stephane; Bulinge, Franck; Boutin, Eric								Salafist presence on social networks: an introduction about an "active minority"								RELIGION(S), SECULARITY(IES), SOCIETY(IES) AND THE DIGITAL HUMANITIES TURN								230	244					2016	2016	This article begins by addressing the relationship often put forward between radical Islam and Salafism. It then seeks to shed light on certain methods of propagating Salafi messages in the media, especially over the Internet. Faced with the problematic nature of Salafi proselytism on social networks, reflection is begun in view of developing a method to create an interdisciplinary digital observatory which is to rely in particular on the notion of latent networks. Elaborating a means to dynamically map the Salafi presence on the Web could help anticipate, in an automated way, certain potentially dangerous movements and serve as a warning system for the relevant departments. So while this is a theoretical reflection, it is also put forward for practical reasons concerning a highly strategic issue. Discussion then turns to how an "active minority" is attempting to effect an ideological conversion and to get other individuals involved. Starting from a question already asked - Islamization of radicalism or radicalization of Islam? new research perspectives emerge, including those that address the ramblings of individuals left to their own devices on the Internet, without information skills, and exposed to messages fostering the emergence of deleterious imagination.

Electronic band structure and visible-light photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6: elucidating the effect of lutetium doping								RSC ADVANCES				6	103			101105	101114		10.1039/c6ra22669h			2016	2016	Bismuth tungstate and 5% Lu-doped bismuth tungstate photocatalysts were synthesized by coprecipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. The effect of lutetium doping on electronic structure was investigated using density functional theory calculations (DFT). The change of morphological and optical band gap was conditioned by lutetium doping. Under visible light irradiation, the as-prepared sheet-like Lu-Bi2WO6 sample exhibits the highest visible-light-responsive photocatalytic performance than pure Bi2WO6 for the degradation of Methylene Blue (MB). The photocatalytic mechanism was explained on the basis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, active trapping measurements and optoelectronic properties.

Using a specific monetary policy announcements and financial indicators database, we find that the European Central Bank's (ECB's) unconventional measures did not systematically have a calming effect: Asset buyout announcements decreased market strains, whereas interest rates and liquidity provision announcements did not. Moreover, liquidity provision seems to have a stressing effect. Our findings are consistent with the theoretical underpinnings according to which forward guidance crucially determines the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies.

Lateral diffusivity coefficients from the dynamics of a SF6 patch in a coastal environment								JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS				153				42	54		10.1016/j.jmarsys.2015.09.003			JAN 2016	2016	The dispersion of a patch of the tracer sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is used to assess the lateral diffusivity in the coastal waters of the western part of the Gulf of Lion (GoL), northwestern Mediterranean Sea, during the Latex10 experiment (September 2010). Immediately after the release, the spreading of the patch is associated with a strong decrease of the SF6 concentrations due to the gas exchange from the ocean to the atmosphere. This has been accurately quantified, evidencing the impact of the strong wind conditions during the first days of this campaign. Few days after the release, as the atmospheric loss of SF6 decreased, lateral diffusivity coefficient at spatial scales of 10 km has been computed using two approaches. First, the evolution of the patch with time was combined with a diffusion-strain model to obtain estimates of the strain rate (gamma = 2.510(-6) s(-1)) and of the lateral diffusivity coefficient (K-h = 23.2 m(2) S-1). Second, a steady state model was applied, showing K-h values similar to the previous method after a period of adjustment between 2 and 4.5 days. This implies that after such period, our computation of K-h becomes insensitive to the inclusion of further straining of the patch. Analysis of sea surface temperature satellite imagery shows the presence of a strong front in the study area. The front clearly affected the dynamics within the region and thus the temporal evolution of the patch. Our results are consistent with previous studies in open ocean and demonstrate the success and feasibility of those methods also under small-scale, rapidly-evolving dynamics typical of coastal environments.

J	Blagouchine, Iaroslav V.								Expansions of generalized Euler's constants into the series of polynomials in pi(-2) and into the formal enveloping series with rational coefficients only								JOURNAL OF NUMBER THEORY				158				365	396		10.1016/j.jnt.2015.06.012			JAN 2016	2016	In this work, two new series expansions for generalized Euler's constants (Stieltjes constants) gamma(m) are obtained. The first expansion involves Stirling numbers of the first kind, contains polynomials in pi(-2) with rational coefficients and converges slightly better than Euler's series Sigma n(-2). The second expansion is a semi-convergent series with rational coefficients only. This expansion is particularly simple and involves Bernoulli numbers with a non-linear combination of generalized harmonic numbers. It also permits to derive an interesting estimation for generalized Euler's constants, which is more accurate than several well-known estimations. Finally, in Appendix A, the reader will also find two simple integral definitions for the Stirling numbers of the first kind, as well an upper bound for them. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
